WIDEAREA

360° INTRUSION DETECTION, ANYWHERE, ANYTIME
Spynel is a unique around-the-clock wide-area surveillance system,
acquiring near real-time full panoramic images with automatic intrusion
detection and tracking capabilities. lt provides powerful situation
awareness through 360 degree visualization of the surroundings. As
a completely passive system, it is invisible to intruders, not vulnerable
to camouflage nor jamming, and operates 24/7, whatever the weather.

Compact and robust, Spynel can be quickly deployed to perform multi events detection over extremely large areas in total darkness, fog,
smoke. An un limited number of tracks are immediately recognized on
highly resolved images, including hardly detectable threats, such as
smal l, slow or tangential moving targets . lt can be a reliable and costeffective standalone perimeter security so lution as well as an added
layer of capability to systems already in place.
