3BSERVER is a smart videoprotection software
~ a s e don asynchronous spiking networks. It observes
and analyzes forms, motions and faces on a given
surveillance zone.
OBSERVER has been designed as an open architecture:
it's up to the user to set up the best system, in each zone
to be placed under surveillance, using a combination
of detectors. The operator can thus define his own
observation strategy, depending on his needs.

Classical intrusion detection systems are not able to
identify the nature of moving objects. They tend t o raise
alarms on every intrusion, hence generating a high false
alarms rate (more than
zones).
