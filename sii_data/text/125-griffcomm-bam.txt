BAM

The “Bodyworn Array Microphone” Picks up subjects directly behind you, while
rejecting noise from all other directions. It even minimises your own voice.
Completely covert under normal clothing.
Fits like a shoulder holster.
The BAM can be used in noisy places such as bars, restaurants, hotel lobbies,
sporting events, and industrial spaces. In many of these locations the operating
range is as much as 20 to 35 feet (6 to 10 meters).
The BAM is ideal because people in a crowd think that someone with their back
turned can’t hear their conversation. Operatives can work much closer to a target
without being detected.
Discrete, highly directional microphone system
24 Microphones
Outputs for headphones, Transmitter and recorder
Effective pick-up range 10-12 feet
Ideal for pub or restaurant type environment
