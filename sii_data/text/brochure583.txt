TMR l 6 E
PC1 Express f o r m factor Digital E l Trunk Passive Board
TMR 16E1 PCle provides the platform to build powerful
applications based on PSTN and GSM Mobile Network
protocols.
The TMR 16E1 PCle is capable of operating in nonintrusi+e monitoring o r terminating modes, this allows
tapping of the network for surveillance o r other ValueAdded Services [as OSS) where required.
Supporting BTT's* broad range of SS7,RI,R2 and
ISDN PR1 based telephony APl's, call monitoring and
recording applications can be developed.

.

Leading chassis manufacturers are removing the legacy
PC1 slots from PCIserver products, replacing them with
higher capacity PCle slots. This change in expansion
bus architecture demands new form factor telephony
boards to be developed. TMR 16E1 PCle is a low profile,
half size PC1 Express board, allowing it to be deployed
in the widest selection of chassis available.
