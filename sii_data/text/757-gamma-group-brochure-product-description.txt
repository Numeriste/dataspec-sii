Remote Monitoring & Infection Solutions
FINFLY ISP

In many real-life operations, physical access to in-country
Target Systems cannot be achieved and covert remote
installation of a Remote Monitoring Solution is required
to be able to monitor the Target from within the
Headquarters.
FinFly ISP is a strategic, countrywide, as well as a tactical
(mobile) solution that can be integrated into an ISP’s
Access and/or Core Network to remotely install the
Remote Monitoring Solution on selected Target Systems.

QUICK INFORMATION
Usage:

· Strategic Operations

Capabilities:

· Deploys Remote Monitoring
Solution on Target System
through ISP Network

Content:

· Hardware/Software

FinFly ISP appliances are based on carrier grade server
technology, providing the maximum reliability and
scalability to meet almost every challenge related to
network topologies. A wide-range of Network Interfaces –
all secured with bypass functions – are available for the
required active network connectivity.
Several passive and active methods of Target Identification –
from online monitoring via passive tapping to interactive
communications between FinFly ISP and the AAA-Servers
– ensure that the Targets are identified and their appropriate
traffic is provided for the infection process.
FinFly ISP is able to infect Files that are downloaded by
the Target on-the-fly or infect the Target by sending
fake Software Updates for popular Software. The new
release now integrates Gamma’s powerful remote infection application FinFly Web to infect Targets on-the-fly by
just visiting any website.

Usage Example: Intelligence Agency
FinFly ISP was deployed in the main Internet Service Provider
networks of the country and was actively used to remotely
deploy a Remote Monitoring Solution on Target Systems. As
the Targets have Dynamic-IP DSL Accounts, they are identified with their Radius Logon Name.

Different Location Possibilities
· FinFly ISP can be used as a tactical or
strategic solution within ISP networks

A tactical solution is mobile and the hardware is dedicated
to the infection tasks inside the access network close to the
targets’ access points. It can be deployed on a short-term
basis to meet tactical requirements focused on either a specific target or a small number of targets in an area.

A strategic solution would be a permanent ISP/countrywide
installation of FinFly ISP to select and infect any target from
the remote headquarters without the need for the LEA to
be on location.
Of course, it is possible to combine tactical and strategic
solutions to reach a maximum of flexibility for the infection
operations.
