Data is Everywhere

Everyone is Going Hybrid

Subjects are using e-mail, web-mail,
voice over IP, web applications and peerto-peer networks to communicate and
share information. And they're doing it
from their cable and DSL connections,
lnternet cafes and even from their
lnternet connected phones and mobile
devices. Yesterday's intercept solutions
can't keep up with the bandwidth
requirements and different deployment
techniques required to capture this data.
Even if they could, reassembling it and
making it easy for an investigator to
understand is a new challenge.

Many organizations have already deployed
data intercept capabilities and whether
they're best-of-breed or not, money has
been spent, personnel have been trained
and the existing system has proven effective
in prosecution. But networks are getting
faster, carriers are not always helpful
when it comes to deployment assistance
and privacy is a top concern. These facts
are driving the industry's move to hybrid

Packet Forensics makes capturing these
new types of data easy and we make
visualizing and investigating them even
easier. With our platform, if you can surf
the lnternet and use e-mail, you can
perform a cyber investigation.

collection platforms.
Packet Forensics smart probes can hone
in on the most specific traffic to save
investigators time and uphold collateral
privacy. Our tactical auto-configuration
innovations make our systems the easiest
and fastest to deploy in the world. And
our performance in modern-day carrier
networks extends the life of existing
collection investments. Best of all, we're
compatible with every other major platform
in the industry.
