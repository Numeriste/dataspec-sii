Link Aggregator

(4) 10/100/1000 Links to
(4) SFP Monitor Ports
Net Optics In-Line 10/100/1000 or Triple-speed Link Aggregator provides a
comprehensive platform for monitoring multiple network links.
All available traffic from up to four full-duplex links (eight half-duplex streams) is
combined and visible to 4 SFP based monitor ports, which leverages monitoring
tool resources. A pool of monitoring tool resources with differing functionality
enables you to consolidate network performance, threat management, and VoIP
analysis tasks into one easy to use device.
Installing monitoring tools on individual links decreases their reach and your ability
to easily analyze traffic with differing tools sets. For this reason, the distribution of
Link Aggregators across the organization ensures that both network and security IT
staff can install the tools they need to do their jobs. The SFP based monitor ports
allow you to use the copper or fiber based monitoring tools of your choice. This
simple plug-and-play solution also addresses the fact that many monitoring tools
only offer a single channel NIC, limiting full-duplex visibility. Simply connect the tool
to the Aggregator when and where you need it most. At least one SFP Monitor Port
Kit is required when purchasing the Link Aggregator.
All network pairs feature fail-open technology that ensures transparent traffic
continuity even in the event of power loss to the Aggregator. For additional
reliability, redundant power supplies are a standard feature.

Passive, Secure Technology

• Supports full-duplex monitoring of four links, increasing monitoring efficiency
• Provides complete full-duplex visibility at 10, 100 or 1000Mbps without
datastream interference or introducing a point of failure
• Passes all traffic (including errors) from all layers for comprehensive
troubleshooting
• Link Fault Detect prevents undetected link failures
• No IP address needed for the Aggregator or monitoring tool, enhancing
monitoring security
• Redundant power ensures monitoring uptime

Ease of Use

• LED indicators show redundant power, speed, link, and activity status
• Front-mounted connectors support easy installation and operation
• Small form-facter pluggable (SFP) monitor port connectors leverages available
monitoring tools
• Compatible with all major manufacturers’ monitoring devices, including protocol
analyzers, probes, and intrusion detection systems
