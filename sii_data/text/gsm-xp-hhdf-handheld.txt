GSM-XP-HHDF Overview
The GSM-XP-HHDF, a complementary product to the GSM-XP-DBDF, significantly
enhances GSM-XP operational effectiveness when locating targets.

A highly unique design the GSM-XP-HHDF dramatically enhances the ability of the
user to operate in new scenarios with a level of covertness previously considered
not possible. The benefits to the user are:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

operate within buildings
direction find targets to within a few metres
small in size can be worn within a shirt pocket
audio and visual target indication
ability to change RF channel in the field
minimise operational time within the danger zone
requires only standard AA batteries

1.1. GSM-XP-HHDF Features
The GSM-XP-HHDF is designed to work in conjunction with both the GSM-XP-V
and GSM-XP-R systems. Available in 2 options, supporting either the GSM-XP
918V/R or GSM-XP 819V/R, location finding of a radiating target mobile can be
performed in conditions where vehicle deployment is not possible.
The key features of the GSM-XP-HHDF are:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

small in size
simple yet flexible user interface.
LED indication to show received signal strength
audio indication
squelch control to allow sensitivity adjustment
volume control
vibration alert
dual band operation
