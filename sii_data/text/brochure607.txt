MA-715A
HF/VHF/UHF Monitor Antenna
The MA-715A HF/VHF/UHF Monitor Antenna is used to intercept communications signals over a frequency range of 2 to 2,000 MHz.
The antenna provides intercepted RF to the monitor receivers of Linkabit’s
MD-405A Signal Intelligence (SIGINT) Receiver/Processor in the AN/PRD13(V)2 SIGINT Manpack System configuration.
There are four separate pieces to the MA-715A antenna:
• Antenna base
• HF/low-VHF blade element
• VHF/UHF monopole element
• Flexible gooseneck

MD-405

The antenna is normally mounted on the handle of the MD-405A, but may be
placed in any convenient location. A 3-foot RF coaxial cable is used to connect
the MA-715A to the MD-405A. However, if the antenna needs to be placed in
another location away from the MD-405A, a longer RF cable can be used.
The MA-715A uses two antenna elements that are combined into a single feed
line. The longer, flexible HF/low-VHF blade element covers the frequency range
up to 175 MHz. The second rubber–duck-type monopole element is used to cover
the 175 to 2,000 MHz frequency range. The flexible gooseneck can be used
between the base and HF/low-VHF blade element to provide a full 90-degree
bend over a 360-degree arc. The blade element can then be positioned without
bending the element itself.
