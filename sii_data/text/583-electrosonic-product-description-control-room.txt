DATA INFRASTRUCTURE

NETWORKED ENVIRONMENTS

Electrosonic understands that the data
infrastructure is critical to the collection,
analysis and distribution of important
intelligence information for the control centre.
Our IT experts will minimise the possib ility of
any disruption to these important systems.

Maintaining a complex networked control room
environment requires a strong understanding of
the underlying technology. You will benefit from
Electrosonic's unmatched experience designing and
engineering systems that distribute video and data
between sites, users and displays using IP networks.

SERVICE OPERATIONS CENTRE (SOC)
Electrosonic's Service Operations Centre (SOC)
operates around the clock to continuously monitor
alerts, open trouble tickets, contact the on-site
team or troubleshoot issues as required.
A call logging system helps ensure that response
times are met. All calls for support are logged
to the centre and our staff then contact the local
technical team to provide a seamless response.
Remote monitoring enables the observation and
management of your audio-visual system from the
SOC. Besides receiving alerts when faults occur
with the equipment, potential problems can be
anticipated and resolved before they impact
your operations.

projector or video wall is a faulty or broken lamp.
