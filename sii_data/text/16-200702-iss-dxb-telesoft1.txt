Definition
Intelligent Probing is:
– Selective Acquisition of data, based on network
signalling and bearer properties
• E.g. DTMF tones, original called number, type of call
• Not just called/calling party numbers

– Handling of incomplete network data
– Real time network data Analysis
• CIC mapping derivations
• Multiple Subscriber Identity/Location correlations

Goals
To provide precise event selection capability
To provide independent access to network data
across network types
– ( GSM/CDMA/3GPP/PSTN/Sattelite )

To provide a single central interface for handover
of the information
To operate in imperfect environments

Intelligent Probing
Probing both signalling and communication
content
– Signalling, examining ALL signalling parameters, not just
called/calling party numbers
–
–
–
–
–

Original Called Number
Redirecting Number
Calling Party Category … etc
Prefix/Suffix/wildcard matching
Number normalisation

– Communications Content
• DTMF digit extraction
• Activity (Energy) detection in timeslots
• Classification of content ( Fax/Modem/Voice )

Complex event selection
Call selection based on complex criteria
–

–
–
–
–
–

Calls from A to B
Calls from A to B redirected to C
Calls only from B
All Fax calls
All Modem calls from A to B
All events on a declared circuit
Events where timeslot energy > -20dBm
SMS from A to C when B is located with A

Independent Access
Intelligent Probes are mostly passive ( nonintrusive ), and therefore independent
Intelligent probes are purpose designed
Able to Acquire data from different
networks/interfaces
Provide Standardised Handover Interfaces ETSI /
CALEA / TIIT etc

Implementation of Intelligent Probes
Acquiring network data occurs in two ways
– Forwarding from existing infrastructure
•
•
•
•
•

‘Internal Interception’
Manufacturer specific implementation
Limited functionality, hard to extend and slow to do
Non core function to network node
Generally focused on minimum LI requirements

– Passive monitoring of interconnects
•
•
•
•
•

Generic access to network data
Rich functionality, easy and fast to extend
Specialised equipment
Wide range of capability
Less ‘visible’

Internal Interception Function

Acquisition from
– Network nodes
– Passive tapping

Each has advantages

Internal vs Off Switch
Internal
– Pros
• No extra equipment necessary
• Handover interface implemented within the equipment
• Access to internal data structures can make it more efficient

– Cons
•
•
•
•

Each manufacturer implements the interface differently
Provisioning of target data is not uniform
Manufacturers often charge for the feature
The switch is forced to perform a non-core task and takes
resources from core tasks
• The switch must be tasked with the LI warrants
• An upgrade in switch s/w can ‘break’ the LI feeds
• On switch solutions can introduce detectable artefacts

Internal vs !Off Switch"
Off Switch
– Pros
• LI function will not affect the network performance or customer
experience.
• Independent of network equipment and vendors. A single
interface presented.
• Defined interfaces for remote tasking.
• More intelligence can be placed in the probe, greatly benefiting
the LEA.
• The same equipment can be used for Intelligence intercept as for
LI.

– Cons
• More equipment must be deployed and managed.

Architecture
Truly intelligent probes can only be offered
through passive acces
Passive monitoring also confers
– A single handover interface for all
LI/Intelligence data
– Single provisioning point
– Electronic provisioning
– Physically Centralized target holding - more
secure

Operation in Imperfect environments
Lawful Intercept usually allows for full access to
signalling and bearers
Intelligence gathering is more opportunistic.
Intelligent probes derive data from incomplete
intercept data
– Only one path (Tx or Rx ) of the signalling and or
bearers may be available
– Data may be of poor quality ( high error rate )
– Only a proportion of bearers may be accessible
– Some signalling may be load shared across links that
are not accessible

Intelligent Probes have specific algorithms for this

Passive Access
Passive Access through tapping of electrical
and optical bearers
Remote and distributed probe deployment
Backhaul to centralised processing

Accumulated handover

Commercial in Confidence

www.telesoft-technologies.com

Page 17

Accumulated Handover
Network signalling and content is probed from
the observed network
Events are relayed to the central processing
server over transfer network
The server makes decisions on recording and
meta data creation ( CDR’s / IRI etc )
The probes are instructed to stream the call
content to a destination recorder.
All decisions are made centrally

What can be Achieved?

Commercial in Confidence

Page 19

Easier collection
Large scale network monitoring from a
single interface
– Disparate technologies, interfaces,locations

Clandestine/opportunistic access
Access with greater security
Passive solution means no compromise to
network integrity

Commercial in Confidence

Page 20

Easier processing
Lower volume of acquired data for analyst
processing, through better selection
Automatic processing of data flows
– e.g. ( Fax-->demodulator->OCR->keyword recognition )

Event triggers based on target proximity
/accumulation/absence
Event triggers based on communication content.

How Relevant is this to 3G networks?

Commercial in Confidence

Page 22

Packet based Networks
Networks are being converged/replaced with
packet based transport
Telephony is still the primary service of such
networks, and therefore must be acquired
Mandated Internal functions scavenge resource
limiting capacity
Selection of the correct flows from packet
networks is even more important

Commercial in Confidence

www.telesoft-technologies.com

Page 23

Access to packet transmission
Passive access to packet transports is
needed
– WAN links with PoS, or the 3GPP Iuxx
interfaces with ATM/HDLC transports
– SIGTRAN signalling transports
– Packet accumulation and forwarding
– LAN links with hardware support for Deep
Packet inspection in real time

But the analysis is identical

Page 24

Legal considerations
The Legal position for packet networks will be
very complex. Unwarrented collection may be
key to national security.
Media Gateways may be located outside
jurisdiction, but signalling will be inside
Warrants for target installation in equipment not
owned by the authority will not be possible

Summary
Intelligent Probing provides
–
–
–
–
–
–

Precise targetting
Reduced workload for analysts- reduced volumes
More secure collection of data
Independent and immediate access to data
Sophisticated triggers (location / proximity)
Network nodes are not required to perform non-core
tasks

A better solution for Intelligence, and for Lawful
Intercept
