deployed once the Target opened the file .

A Target was identified within a Discussion Board but no
direct or Email contact was possible . The Agency created a
Webserver containing an Internet Explorer 0-day Exploit
which deployed the Payload on the Target System once the
Target opened the URL that was sent to him through a
private message in the Discussion Board.

Remote Monitoring & Deployment Solutions

FINFLY ISP

ln many real- life operations, physica l access to in-country
Target Systems cannot be achieved, and a covert remote
installation of a Remote Mon itoring Solution is required to
be able to monitor the Target from within Headquarters.

QUICK INFORMATION
· Strategic Operations
· Deploys Remote Monitoring
Solution on Target System
through ISP Network

Fin Fly ISP is a strategic, countrywide, as well as a tactical
(mobile) solution, that can be integrated into an ISP's
Access and/or Core Network, to remote ly install the
Remote Monitoring Solution on se lected Target Systems.

· Hardware/Software

FinFly ISP appliances are based on carrier grade server
technology, providing a maximum of reliability and
scalability to meet almost every challenge related to networks' topologies. A wide range of Network Interfaces all secured with bypass functions - is available for the
required active network connectivity.
Several passive and active methods of Target Identification from online monitoring via passive tapping to interactive
communication between FinFly ISP and the AAA-Servers ensure that the Targets are identified and their appropriate
traffic will be provided for the deployment process .
FinFly ISP is able to patch Files that are downloaded by
the Target on-the-fly or send fake Software Updates for
popu lar Software. The new re lease integrates Gamma's
powerful remote deployment application FinFly WEB that
injects a Payload to any website visited by the Target.

Usage Example: Intelligence Agency
FinFly ISP was deployed in the main Internet Service
Provider networks of the country and was actively used to
remotely deploy a Remote Monitoring Solution on Target
Systems. As the Targets have Dynamic-IP DSL Accounts,
they are identified with their Radius Logon Name.

Feature Overview
· Can be insta lled inside an Internet Service Provider's Networks
· Handles all common Protocols
· Selected Targets by IP Address, Radius Login Name, DHCP and MSISDN
· Hides Remote Monitoring Solution in Downloads of Targets
· lnjects a Remote Monitoring Solution as Software Updates
· Remotely insta lls a Remote Monitoring Solution through Websites visited by the Target

For a full feature list, please refer to the Product Specifications.

Different Location Possibilities
· FinFly ISP can be used as a tactical or
strategic so luti on within ISP networks

ISP Network

... more tactical

RADIUS
DHCP

A tactical solution is mobile and the hardware is dedicated
to the deployment tasks inside the access network close to
the targets' access points. lt can be deployed on a shortterm basis to meet tacticâl requirements focused on a
specific target or a small number of targets in an area .

A strategic soluti on wou ld be a permanent ISP/co untrywide
installation of FinFly ISP to select targets and deploy payloads from the remote headquarters without the need for
the LEA to be on location .
Of course, it is possible to combine tactical and strategic
solutions to reach a maximum of flexibility for the deployment
ope rations .

Tactical IT Intrusion Portfolio

FINFIREWIRE

Technical Surveillance Units and Forensic Experts often face
a situation where they need to access a running computer
system without shutting it down in order to prevent data
loss or save essential time during an operation . ln most
cases, the Target System is protected with a passwordenabled Screensaver or the target user is not logged in
and the Login Screen is active.
FinFireWire enables the Operator to quick ly and covertly
bypass the password-protected screen and access the
Target System without leaving a trace or harming essential
forensic evidence .

Bypasses User Password
Covertly Accesses System
Recovers Passwords from RAM
Enables Live Forensics

Usage Example 1: Forensic Operation

Usage Example 2: Password Recovery

A Forensic Unit entered the apartment of a Target and
tried to access the computer system. The computer was
switched on but the screen was locked.
As they were not allowed, for legal reasons, to use a Remote
Monitoring Solution, they would have lost all data by switching off the system as the hard-disk was fully encrypted.
FinFireWire was used to unlock the running Target
System enabling the Agent to copy all files before
switching the computer off and taking it back to Headquarters.

Combining the product with traditional Forensic
applications like Encase®, Foren sic units used the
RAM dump functionality to make a snapshot of the
current RAM information and recovered the Hard-Disk
encryption passphrase for TrueCrypt's full disk encryption.

Feature Overview
· Unlocks User-Logon for every User-Account
· Unlocks Password-Protected Screensaver

· Dumps full RAM for Forensic analysis
· Enables live forensics without rebooting the Target System
: User password is not changed
· Supports Windows, Mac OSX and Linux
· Works with FireWire/1394, PCMCIA and Express Card
