Advantages of Passive Probes
Introduction
A call detail record (CDR) is created for every call made in the telecommunication network by the
network elements (switches) through which the call is routed. These are usually passed to the
operational and billing support systems, which provide services such as monitoring the network
for quality of service, creating the customer bills and fraud prevention.
Call detail records can also be extracted from the network by passively monitoring (via a “tap” on
the network interface itself) the telecommunication network. This provides the ability to create
more complex ‘enhanced’ CDR files, with the added security of a network independent solution.
This CDR extraction functionality can all be provided by the HINTON passive probe product
range, either as a primary function, or in addition to lawful interception and location monitoring
functionality also offered by the probe.

What is a Call Data Record?

Application
When deployed in a telecommunications network for any monitoring purposes (for example
lawful interception, or location monitoring) the HINTON product generates CDR files for all calls
(successful or unsuccessful) that occur on the monitored network interfaces. These files are
generated for calls regardless of whether interception or any other action has taken place against
an active filter, making the files suitable for use in a variety of applications including:

While these functions can be achieved with the use of CDR functionality

(accessible to all network engineers) to a secure network independent
system with restricted access.
