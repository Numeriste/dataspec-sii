designed to specification hardware and software solutions

Amesys technical expertise is renowned on the Defense/ Security market especially for
its innovative Signal Intelligence and Electronic Warfare systems.
Over the years, Amesys has developed a complete portfoliQ of intelligence products
answering the needs of both government and law enforcement agencies. With
a wide range of captors, Amesys' solutions are clearly designed to fulfill the increasing
need of intelligence against new terrorist or criminal threats.
Amesys proposes the widest range of interception solutions systems for land, air and sea
applications.
Amesys covers all the COM INT [Communication Intelligence) and lawful interception
issues such as collection [detection, recording, direction finding and position fixing,
identification), analysis, dissemination, simulation and training.
Amesys COMINT and lawful interception systems gather intelligence through passive
"list ening" to radio communications and networks.
Amesys products are designed on scalable technologies to provide solutions from the
tactical level to the strategic one.
Amesys maintains its products operational in the long run, thanks to its obsolescence
management expertise, protocols follow-up and frequent software update releases.

Some Amesys COMINT and lawful interception products are submitted to export and
sales clearance.

INTELLIGENCE '

LAWFUL INTERCEPTION
The main goal of Lawful Interception is to analyze in deep the
traffic of predefined targets. In LI systems, all the target's
traffic is duplicated by the Service Provider (phone, mobile or
Internet) and is sent to a centralized interception system. Then,
the investigators analyze as deeply as possible all the traffic of
each target.
A Lawful system should then provide specific tools to help
investigators in this in-deep analysis and also dedicated
workflows to seal raw contents and to provide legal evidence to
be used in court.
The LI filters are typically IP addresses for internet interception
or phone numbers for mobile or fixed phone interception.

INTELLIGENCE (MASSIVE ,l\ITERCEPTION)
Intelligence systems are often much more complex than LI
systems, because they have to scan and intercept the target's
traffic and also to provide the advanced tools needed to find
potential new targets in, typically, billions of communications.
These systems are often connected directly through passive
equipments to the service provider network and are able to
analyze the whole country's traffic in real time.

•
•

Intelligence systems include most of the time an optimized
archive able to store the input traffic and smart processes to
access the huge volume of information stored in that archive.
The Intelligence filters are typically more consolidated than LI
ones such as e-mail addresses, nick names, language used,
keywords...

Amesys has developed a complete core technology called EAGLE to cover Lawful
Interception and COMINT needs.

EAGLE CORE TECHNOLOGY
EAGLE breaks down in four distinct parts :
The Captor(s) collecting the data: Totally passive captors can be used on any type
of support to increase the operational coverage of the system.

The Data Center for classification and storage: Entirely scalable hardware built
on clusters of multi-core processors combined with smart storage management. It
improves the analysis and classification capacity of the entire system.

" The Monitoring Center: Easy-to-use graphical user interface enhances operational
workflow and helps operators to increase the effectiveness and the relevance of the
production process.

• The Smart Analysis Tools: State-of-the-art smart modules increase the
effectiveness of incoming interceptions classification, including traffic analysis,
speaker identification, voice translation, transcription etc.

The COMPLE:TE: SOLUTION

FLEXIBLE AND SCALABLE ARCHITECTURE
Amesys Intelligence Products are designed to help
you to keep pace with changing operational needs.
All the parts of the EAGLE core technology are
designed to fit exactly your needs and to be gradually
upgraded to follow the growth of your communication
networks.
EAGLE has been designed to be the corner stone of
a fully scalable solution that can be interfaced with
existing solutions to obtain the best intelligence
system. EAGLE is suitable for tactical and nationwide
needs.

The creation of a folder is very easy to handle. Thanks to a wizard, you can, depending
on the use of the system, create folders based on a LllD (Lawful Interception ID) or on
advanced criteria like e-mail address, chat identifier, phone number, etc.

Once a folder has been processed, an automatically generated graphical
representation of the social network can be displayed, helping the operators to
establish the relationships between suspects. This representation allows the user to access
the different 1ntercept1ons by clicking on the graph's hnks.
This social network representation can be displayed in addition to a timeline representing
chronologically the communications between suspects.
