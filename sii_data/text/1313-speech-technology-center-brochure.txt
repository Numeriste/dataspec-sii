SMART Tracker FRS
Face recognition solution for real-time biometric search
and facial D 6 management in law-enforcement and s,ecurity agencies
V~deosumelllance becomes more and more s~gn~f~cant

By concentrating people at h ~ g hdens~tyIn access~bleplaces, at regular or pred~ctabletimes, mass gathertngs present the opportunity for

Next-generat~onIntellectual v~deosurvelllance systems should be deployed m places of mass gathering Such systems may contaln "state-of~dent~f~cation

checkpoints can be found In the entry and exit zones of tram stations, stadiums, subways, airports and In any other place, where the speed of a
stream of people IS llmlted.
SMART Tracker FRS deployed In a real-t~memode has the following performance parameters: a dangerous person will be detected In 97 cases
