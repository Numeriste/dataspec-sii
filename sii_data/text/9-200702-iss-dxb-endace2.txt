This discussion covers how established commercially available technologies can
be integrated to provide secure and separate access to network traffic for LI,
while also enabling operators to garner useful information for WAN security and
management. Operators can now generate a meaningful ROI on an asset base
that would otherwise only serve for regulatory compliance."

The cost of LI compliance
Case study

! Network size:>1200 Cisco 12000 routers
Transporting traffic from >50 million users
! Network types: OC-192, OC-48, OC-12, Gigabit Ethernet
! Total number of monitoring nodes: Thousands of links
! Challenge: How to record target #data-in-motion! from anywhere in the network
! Estimated cost to deploy LI boxes: Totally unfathomable

“If we deploy all that equipment for LI, will
there ever be a return on the
investment?”

! Independent systems for Lawful Intercept ensure
separation/security…
… but the cost to implement capture equipment
for this sole purpose is prohibitive.
! As most vendors focus on Gigabit Ethernet (for
the volume market) it is not possible to tap legacy
or SDH networks. Networks are rarely single
wiretype.
! Vendors of vertically integrated systems will be
forced to reengineer their solutions as network
speeds scale to 10 Gigabit and beyond.
! Will picking one system vendor limit our ability to
integrate with the necessary mediation layer(s)
that are mandated by legislation/LEAs?

Building a scalable monitoring infrastructure
From a network stack perspective
! Internal network operations to
intercept and record traffic are
separated from the mediation
layer(s). (ie. See ETSI model)
! The infrastructure is applicationagnostic (any traffic analysis
applications and LI mediation
systems can be layered on top)

benefit also:
• Manage service delivery
• Offer revenue-generating

Implementation

Performed by Endace infrastructure

Performed by the applications

! Consistent full-line rate traffic recording
! Hardware-based traffic filtering ensures
nothing is missed
! Precise timestamping (15 nanoseconds,
synchronised by GPS to ~100ns)
! Interface with multiple applications
concurrently, each with it!s own separate
traffic stream.
! Secure delivery of captured data to the
mediation layer (and/or analysis
applications)
! Provides an API for configuring the
capture infrastructure from within the
mediation/analysis software.

! User authorisation & warrant
management.
! Provides #front-end! user interface to the
lawful intercept team.
! Send requests for intercepts to the
infrastructure
! Store intercepted data and deliver it to
the LEA.

The cost of LI compliance
Case study
! Network size: >1200 Cisco 12000 routers
Transporting traffic from >50 million users
! Network types: OC-192, OC-48, OC-12, Gigabit Ethernet
! Total number of monitoring nodes: Thousands of links
! Challenge: How to record target #data-in-motion! from anywhere in the network
! Estimated cost to deploy LI boxes: Totally unfathomable
! Solution: Using Endace network monitoring infrastructure, lossless traffic capture is
guaranteed at full line rate across a range of network types, network-wide.
! Augmented solution for LI: Adding the mediation layer from a leading LI vendor,
the Endace monitoring probes are configured to record and securely deliver targeted
traffic streams.
! This is not the sole purpose! The monitoring infrastructure is also leveraged by the
in-house service performance monitoring team, and the Security Operations Centre.
! Total cost: Justifiable (US$ millions)

! This project is presently being rolled out.
