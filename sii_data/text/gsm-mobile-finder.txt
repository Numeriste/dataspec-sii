GSM Mobile Finder (GSM-MF)

General Description
In connection with the GSM mobile tracer & locator (GSM-MTL3), the GSM mobile
finder (GSM-MF) enables pinpoint localization of mobile phones. The device
provides 50 reception channels for selection of an unassigned frequency.
The wide range of its reception dynamics (-100 dBm to +7 dBm) ensures
localization of both adjacent and distant mobile phones.
An especially designed aerial enables systematic direction detection and, thus, a
rapid approach to the sought mobile phone.
The compact design of the device ensures concealed operation.
Absolute reception field strength of the respective channel is shown on a display
(1 dB steps).
Relative field strength is signaled through changing tone pitch or intermitted
sound.
