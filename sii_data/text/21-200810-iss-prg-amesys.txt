From Lawful to Massive Interception: Aggregation of sources.

! Lawful interception :
! Basic filtering on IP address

! Extracts some communications from the
global flow

! Analyze only these communications
! Only work on predefined targets
! All the rest will be permanently lost

From Lawful to Massive Interception: Aggregation of sources.

! Massive interception :
! Advanced filtering tools :
! email address, phone number, ISP
account identifier, ...

! Analyze all the communications of the
link

! Archive of all Internet traffic - Smart
search engine to recover
communications in the past

! All the communications are store in the
system
