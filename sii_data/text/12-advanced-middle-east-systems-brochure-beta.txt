The BETA2 unit is a high performance FPGA based GSM Deciphering Unit (AS/1 and AS/2), it can be
used for any off the air interception front end units, for passive and active solutions.
The connection to those front ends is through a simple Ethernet connection, the unit needs a few
bursts for each communication from the front end equipment, allowing the use of low data rate
connection if necessary. Then the BETA2 GSM will send back the Kc to the front end for real time
decryption.
The small size and the low consumption of the equipment allow the BETA2 GSM to be mounted in a
car or armored vehicle for example.

Several front end can use the BETA2 GSM as it is accessible through any ethernet network, the performance of the equipment is 6Kc/s for the first solution up to 20Kc/s for the high end one.
This deciphering unit can also be cascadable (modulo 20Kc/s) in order to achieve a high number of Keis
for a centralized solution for example.
The equipment is composed of a 1U chassis for the FPGA part of the solution and a 2U chassis for the
storage part.

CHARACTERISTICS
AS/1 and AS/2 deciphering unit for off the air GSM interception front end
Performance: up to 20Kc/s for A5.1 and almost real time for A5.2
Probability of success: more than 95% with normal BER on the communication
