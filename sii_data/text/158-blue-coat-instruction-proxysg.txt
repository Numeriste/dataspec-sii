licence more free than that.
OpenSSH contains no GPL code.

Copyrights

1) As far as I am concerned, the code I have written for this software can be used freely for any purpose. Any derived versions of this software must be clearly
marked as such, and if the derived work is incompatible with the protocol description in the RFC file, it must be called by a name other than "ssh" or "Secure
Shell".
[Tatu continues]
However, I am not implying to give any licenses to any patents or copyrights held by third parties, and the software includes parts that are not under my
direct control. As far as I know, all included source code is used in accordance with the relevant license agreements and can be used freely for any purpose
(the GNU license being the most restrictive); see below for details.
[However, none of that term is relevant at this point in time. All of these restrictively licenced software components which he talks about have been removed
from OpenSSH, i.e.,
- RSA is no longer included, found in the OpenSSL library
- IDEA is no longer included, its use is deprecated
- DES is now external, in the OpenSSL library
- GMP is no longer used, and instead we call BN code from OpenSSL
- Zlib is now external, in a library
- The make-ssh-known-hosts script is no longer included
- TSS has been removed
- MD5 is now external, in the OpenSSL library
- RC4 support has been replaced with ARC4 support from OpenSSL
- Blowfish is now external, in the OpenSSL library
[The licence continues]
Note that any information and cryptographic algorithms used in this software are publicly available on the Internet and at any major bookstore, scientific
library, and patent office worldwide. More information can be found e.g. at "http://www.cs.hut.fi/crypto".
The legal status of this program is some combination of all these permissions and restrictions. Use only at your own responsibility. You will be responsible for
any legal consequences yourself; I am not making any claims whether possessing or using this is legal or not in your country, and I am not taking any
responsibility on your behalf.
NO WARRANTY
BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE
PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY
COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE
TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES
SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER
OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

LEGAL ISSUES
============
In plain English:
1. We don't promise that this software works. (But if you find any bugs, please let us know!)
2. You can use this software for whatever you want. You don't have to pay us.
3. You may not pretend that you wrote this software. If you use it in a program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that
you've used the IJG code.
In legalese:
The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied, with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or fitness
for a particular purpose. This software is provided "AS IS", and you, its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.
This software is copyright (C) 1991-1998, Thomas G. Lane. All Rights Reserved except as specified below.
Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these conditions:
(1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice
unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation. (2) If only executable code
is distributed, then the accompanying documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG Group". (3)
Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept NO LIABILITY
for damages of any kind.
These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code, not just to the unmodified library. If you use our work, you ought to
acknowledge us.
Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived
from it. This software may be referred to only as "the Independent JPEG Group's software".
We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are assumed
by the product vendor.
ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch, sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA.
ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally,
that you must include source code if you redistribute it. (See the file ansi2knr.c for full details.) However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part of any
program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than the foregoing paragraphs do.
The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf. It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable. The
same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub, ltconfig, ltmain.sh). Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by M.I.T. but is also freely
distributable.
It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi. Hence arithmetic coding cannot
legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses. For this reason, support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software. (Since
arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will support it.) So far as
we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining code.
The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files. To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has been
removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce "uncompressed GIFs". This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the resulting
GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard GIF decoders.
We are required to state that "The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of CompuServe Incorporated. GIF(sm) is a Service Mark
property of CompuServe Incorporated."
The FreeType Project LICENSE
2006-Jan-27
Copyright 1996-2002, 2006 by David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg
Introduction
=========
The FreeType Project is distributed in several archive packages; some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine, various tools and
contributions which rely on, or relate to, the FreeType Project.
This license applies to all files found in such packages, and which do not fall under their own explicit license. The license affects thus the FreeType font
engine, the test programs, documentation and makefiles, at the very least.
This license was inspired by the BSD, Artistic, and IJG (Independent JPEG Group) licenses, which all encourage inclusion and use of free software in
commercial and freeware products alike. As a consequence, its main points are that:
o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)
o You can use this software for whatever you want, in parts or full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)
o You may not pretend that you wrote this software. If you use it, or only parts of it, in a program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your
documentation that you have used the FreeType code. (`credits')
We specifically permit and encourage the inclusion of this software, with or without modifications, in commercial products. We disclaim all warranties
covering The FreeType Project and assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.

Copyrights

Finally, many people asked us for a preferred form for a credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license. We thus encourage you to use the
following text:
“Portions of this software are copyright (c) 2007The FreeType Project (www.freetype.org). All rights reserved."
Legal Terms
=========
0. Definitions
Throughout this license, the terms `package', `FreeType Project', and `FreeType archive' refer to the set of files originally distributed by the authors (David
Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha, beta or final release.
`You' refers to the licensee, or person using the project, where `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source code as well as linking it to
form a `program' or `executable'. This program is referred to as `a program using the FreeType engine'.
This license applies to all files distributed in the original FreeType Project, including all source code, binaries and documentation, unless otherwise
stated in the file in its original, unmodified form as distributed in the original archive. If you are unsure whether or not a particular file is covered by this
license, you must contact us to verify this.
The FreeType Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000 by David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg. All rights reserved except as specified below.
1. No Warranty
THE FREETYPE PROJECT IS PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE
AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED BY THE USE OR THE INABILITY TO USE, OF THE FREETYPE
PROJECT.
2. Redistribution
This license grants a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual and irrevocable right and license to use, execute, perform, compile, display, copy, create
derivative works of, distribute and sublicense the FreeType Project (in both source and object code forms) and derivative works thereof for any purpose;
and to authorize others to exercise some or all of the rights granted herein, subject to the following conditions:
o Redistribution of source code must retain this license file (`FTL.TXT') unaltered; any additions, deletions or changes to the original files must be clearly
indicated in accompanying documentation. The copyright notices of the unaltered, original files must be preserved in all copies of source files.
o Redistribution in binary form must provide a disclaimer that states that the software is based in part of the work of the FreeType Team, in the distribution
documentation. We also encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page in your documentation, though this isn't mandatory.
These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the FreeType Project, not just the unmodified files. If you use our work, you must
acknowledge us. However, no fee need be paid to us.
3. Advertising
Neither the FreeType authors and contributors nor you shall use the name of the other for commercial, advertising, or promotional purposes without
specific prior written permission.
We suggest, but do not require, that you use one or more of the following phrases to refer to this software in your documentation or advertising materials:
`FreeType Project', `FreeType Engine', `FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'.
As you have not signed this license, you are not required to accept it. However, as the FreeType Project is copyrighted material, only this license, or
another one contracted with the authors, grants you the right to use, distribute, and modify it. Therefore, by using, distributing, or modifying the
FreeType Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms of this license.
4. Contacts
There are two mailing lists related to FreeType:
o freetype@nongnu.org
Discusses general use and applications of FreeType, as well as future and wanted additions to the library and distribution. If you are looking for support,
start in this list if you haven't found anything to help you in the documentation.
o freetype-devel@nongnu.org
Discusses bugs, as well as engine internals, design issues, specific licenses, porting, etc.
Our home page can be found at http://www.freetype.org
======================
zip.cpp—which is used by the Data Collector utility included in the SG Client software—is almost entirely based upon code by info-zip. It has been
modified by Lucian Wischik. The modifications were a complete rewrite of the bit of code that generates the layout of the zipfile, and support for zipping
tofrom memory or handles or pipes or pagefile or diskfiles, encryption, unicode.
The original code may be found at http:www.info-zip.org. The original copyright text follows.
This is version 1999-Oct-05 of the Info-ZIP copyright and license.
The definitive version of this document should be available at ftp:ftp.cdrom.compubinfoziplicense.html indefinitely.

Chapter 2: Licensing

This chapter describes the SG appliance licensing behavior.

About Licensing
SGOS 5.x features a global licensing system for the SGOS software. License key files are
issued on a per-appliance basis. One license key file includes all of the component
licenses for whichever SGOS features you have elected to use.
Note: When your Blue Coat appliance order was completed, you received an e-mail
that contained serial numbers for licensable components. Those numbers are required
for the procedures in this chapter.

Licensable Components

SG Client—
Acceleration

Entitles you to support a certain number of SG Clients in your
enterprise; however, the license does not limit the number of
ADN tunnels to which clients can have access. SG Client
licenses are upgradeable so you can support a larger number of
users.

Note: Only the appliance designated as the SG Client Manager
requires a license. To use SG Clients in your enterprise, apply
the license only to the Client Manager and not to any other
appliances in the ADN network.

About the Trial Period
Blue Coat provides a trial period, enabled by default. During initial configuration of new
hardware, you can specify an edition of SGOS to run during the trial period. The SG
appliance can run either the MACH5 or Proxy Edition of SGOS during the trial period.

22

Chapter 2: Licensing

Note: If you select Proxy Edition for the trial period but you purchase a MACH5
Edition license, the SG appliance configuration is reset when you install the license.
Note also that a few defaults—default proxy policy, trust destination IP address, and
tolerating HTTP requests—differ between the two editions.

The initial system boot-up triggers the 60-day trial; during this time you can evaluate the
SGOS functionality. For the first 60 days, all licensable components for the trial edition
you chose are active and available to use. When a license or demo license is installed
during the trial period, components previously available in the trial period, but not part of
that license, remain available and active for the remainder of the trial period. However, if
the license edition is different than the trial edition you selected, only functionality
available in the edition specified in the license remains available for trial.
Each time you navigate to the Management Console License Warning page, you see a text
message that identifies the expiration date of your trial period; the Maintenance >
Licensing > View tab shows the license components with expiration dates. If you require
more time to explore the SGOS features, a demo license is available; refer to your reseller
or contact Blue Coat Sales.
In the trial period, the Base SGOS user limit is unlimited. When a full license is installed,
any user limits imposed by that license are enforced, even if the trial period is still valid.

Disabling the Components Running in Trial Period
You have the option to not let users access features that are currently running in trial
period; however, you cannot selectively disable trial period features. You must either
enable all of them or disable all of them.
To disable trial period components:
1.

On the View License tab, select Disable in the Trial Components are enabled field.

2.

Click Apply.

3.

Click Refresh Data. All licenses that are in trial period switch from Yes to No. Users
cannot use these features, and no dialogs warning of license expiration are sent.

Also notice that this option text changes to Trial Components are disabled: Enabled. Repeat
this process to re-enable trial licenses.

About License Expiration
At the end of the trial or demo period or, subsequently, when any normally licensed
component expires, components that have not been licensed do not process requests. A
license expiration notification message is logged in the Event Log (refer to the Event log
information in Volume 8: Managing the Blue Coat SG Appliance for details).
If a license expires, users might not receive notification, depending upon the application
they are using. Notifications do occur for the following:
❐

HTTP (Web browsers)—An HTML page is displayed stating the license has expired.

❐

SSL—An exception page appears when an HTTPS connection is attempted.

❐

Instant Messaging clients—Users do not receive a message that the license has expired.
Any IM activity is denied, and to the user it appears that the logon connection has
failed.

23

Volume 1: Getting Started

❐

FTP clients—If the FTP client supports it, a message is displayed stating the license has
expired.

❐

Streaming media clients—If the Windows Media Player, RealPlayer, or QuickTime
player version supports it, a message is displayed stating the license has expired.

❐

SG Client—After the trial license has expired, clients cannot connect to the ADN
network.

You can still perform SGOS configuration tasks, CLI, SSH console, serial console, or Telnet
connection. Although the component becomes disabled, feature configurations are not
altered. Also, policy restrictions remain independent of component availability.

About the System Serial Number
Each SG serial number is the appliance identifier used to assign a license key file. The SG
appliance contains an EEPROM with the serial number encoded. The appliance
recognizes the serial number upon system boot-up.
The serial number is visible by navigating to Configuration > General > Identification.

Obtaining a WebPower Account
Before you can register your SG appliance and retrieve the license key, you must have a
Blue Coat WebPower user account.
If you do not have a WebPower account or have forgotten your account information, use
the following procedure.
To obtain a WebPower account:
1.

Select Maintenance > Licensing > Install.

2.

In the License Administration field, click Register/Manage. The License Configuration
and Management Web page appears (ignore the dialog at this time).

3.

Perform one of the following:
To obtain a new account, click the link for Need a WebPower User ID. Enter the
information as prompted.
To obtain your current information for an existing account, click the Forgot your
password link.

Registering and Licensing Blue Coat Hardware and Software
This section describes how to automatically register the hardware and software with Blue
Coat.
❐

If you have not manually registered the hardware, you can automatically register the
hardware and install the software license in one step. Continue with “To register the
hardware and software” on page 25.

❐

If you have new hardware (SG210, SG510, SG810, SG 8100) that previously has been
registered, the license is already associated with the hardware. Go to Maintenance >
Licensing > Install and click Retrieve to obtain the license. For more information, see
“To retrieve the software license:” on page 26.

24

Chapter 2: Licensing

Note: A message is written to the event log when you install a license
through the SG appliance.

•

The license is now installed. All features that you subscribed to are fully operational.

Manually Updating a License
After the initial license installation, you might decide to use another feature that requires a
license. The license must be updated to support the new feature.
To update a license:
1.

Select Maintenance > Licensing > Install.

2.

Click Register/Manage.

3.

Follow the instructions on the Blue Coat License Self-Service Web page.

4.

If using the automatic license installation feature, click Update; otherwise, manually
install the license as described in “Manual License Installation” on page 26.

Automatically Updating a License
The license automatic update feature allows the SG appliance to contact the Blue Coat
licensing Web page 31 days before the license is to expire. If a new license has been
purchased and authorized, the license is automatically downloaded. If a new license is not
available on the Web site, the SG appliance continues to contact the Web site daily for a
new license until the current license expires. Outside the above license expiration window,
the SG appliance performs this connection once every 30 days to check for new license
authorizations. This feature is enabled by default.
To configure the license auto-update:
1.

Select Maintenance > Licensing > Install.

2.

Select Use Auto-Update.

3.

Select Apply to commit the changes to the SG appliance.

Chapter 3: Accessing the SG Appliance

The SGOS software uses the Secure Shell (SSH) and HTTPS protocols to securely access
the SGOS CLI and Management Console. Both SSHv1 and SSHv2 are enabled by
default, and host keys have already been created on the SG appliance.
All data transmitted between the client and the SG appliance using SSH/HTTPS is
encrypted.
During initial configuration, you assigned the SG appliance a username and password
and a privileged-mode (enabled/configuration) password. These passwords are
always stored and displayed hashed.
This chapter discusses:
❐

“Before You Begin: Understanding Modes” on page 31

❐

“Accessing the SG Appliance” on page 32

❐

“Accessing the Management Console Home Page” on page 33

❐

“Changing the Logon Parameters” on page 34

❐

“Viewing the Appliance Health” on page 37

Important: This chapter assumes that you have completed the first-time setup of the
SG appliance using either the front panel or serial console, and that the appliance is
running on the network. These steps must be completed before accessing the appliance.

You can manage the SG appliance by logging on to and using one of the following:
❐

An SSH session to access the CLI.

❐

The Management Console graphical interface.

You can also use a serial console to access the CLI.
Note: To use a Telnet session, you must use a serial console connection until you
configure Telnet for use. (For security reasons Blue Coat does not recommend using
Telnet).

Before You Begin: Understanding Modes
SGOS 5.x supports different levels of command security:
❐

Standard, or unprivileged, mode is read-only. You can see but not change system
settings and configurations. This is the level you enter when you first access the CLI.

❐

Enabled, or privileged, mode is read-write. You can make immediate but not
permanent changes to the SG appliance, such as restarting the system. This is the
level you enter when you first access the Management Console.

❐

Configuration is a mode within the Enabled mode. From this level, you can perform
permanent changes to the SG appliance configuration.

If you use the Management Console, you are in configuration mode when you log into
Enabled mode and type conf t.

31

Volume 1: Getting Started

If you use the CLI, you must enter each level separately:
Username: admin
Password:
SGOS> enable
Enable Password:
SGOS# configure terminal
Enter configuration commands, one per line. End with CTRL-Z.
SGOS#(config)

For detailed information about the CLI and the CLI commands, refer to Volume 11:
Command Line Interface Reference.
Note: Although most administrator tasks can be performed using either the
Management Console or the CLI, there is the occasional task that can only be done using
one of the two: these are specified in the manual.

Accessing the SG Appliance
You can access the SG appliance through either the CLI or the Management Console. By
default, SSHv2 (CLI) and HTTPS (Management Console) are used to connect to the
appliance.
The SSH and HTTPS ports are configured and enabled. For SSH, you can use either
version 1 or version 2 (with password or RSA client key authentication).

Accessing the CLI
If you use the CLI, you can use SSHv2 to access the SG appliance, but you cannot use
SSHv1 or Telnet without additional configuration.
Note: Enabling the Telnet-Console introduces a security risk, so it is not recommended.

To use SSHv1, you must first create an SSHv1 host key. For more information on creating
SSH host keys, refer to Volume 2: Proxies and Proxy Services.
To log on to the CLI, you must have:
❐

the account name that has been established on the SG appliance

❐

the IP address of the SG appliance

❐

the port number (22 is the default port number)

You must log on from your SSH client.

Accessing the Management Console
The Management Console is a graphical Web interface that allows you to manage,
configure, monitor, and upgrade the SG appliance from any location.
In the Web browser, enter HTTPS, the SG appliance IP address, and port 8082 (the default
management port). For example, if the IP address configured during first-time installation
is 10.25.36.47, enter the URL https://10.25.36.47:8082 in the Web browser.

Chapter 5: Archive Configuration

Blue Coat allows you to use an existing configuration (modified to include only general
parameters, not system-specific settings) to quickly set up a newly-manufactured SG
appliance and to save the running configuration off-box for archival purposes.
This section discusses:
❐

“Sharing Configurations” on page 45

❐

“Archiving a Configuration” on page 48

Sharing Configurations
You can share configurations between two SG appliances. You can take a post-setup
configuration file (one that does not include those configuration elements that are
established in the setup console) from an already-configured SG appliance and push it
to a newly-manufactured system.
Note: Blue Coat Director allows you to push a configuration from one SG

appliance to multiple appliances at the same time. For more information on using
Director, see Volume 8: Managing the Blue Coat SG Appliance.
The new configuration is applied to the existing configuration, changing any existing
values. This means, for instance, that if the new configuration creates a realm called
RealmA and the existing configuration has a realm called RealmB, the combined
configuration includes two realms, RealmA and RealmB.
To share configurations, you must
❐

Change all "encrypted-password" entries to "password" followed by the actual
password in quotes.

❐

Change any "hashed-password" entries to "password" followed by the actual
password in quotes.

❐

Make sure that no services are tied to a specific proxy IP address.

❐

Download a content filter database, if the configuration includes content filtering.

You can use either the Management Console or the CLI to create a post-setup
configuration file on one SG appliance and push it to another.
Note: You cannot push configuration settings to a newly manufactured system
until you have completed initial setup of the system.

To create and push a configuration to a newly manufactured SG appliance:
From the already configured SG appliance:
1.

Select Configuration > General > Archive.

45

Chapter 5: Archive Configuration

Note: A message is written to the event log when you install a configuration
through the SG appliance.

5.

Click Close.

To create and push a configuration to a newly manufactured SG appliance:
From the already configured SG appliance:
1.

From the enable prompt (#), determine which configuration you want to use for the
new system. The syntax is:
show configuration post-setup | brief | expanded

where:

2.

3.

post-setup

This displays the configuration on the current system,
minus any configurations created through the setup
console, such as the hostname and IP address. It also
includes the installable lists.

brief

This displays the configuration on the current system, but
does not include the installable lists.

expanded

This is the most complete snapshot of the system
configuration, but it contains system-specific settings that
should not be pushed to a new system.

Save the configuration. You can save the file two ways:
•

Copy the contents of the configuration to the clipboard. (Paste the file into the
terminal on the newly-manufactured system.)

•

Save it as a text file on a download FTP server accessible to the SG appliance. This
is advised if you want to re-use the file.

On the newly-manufactured SG appliance, retrieve the configuration file by doing
one of the following:
•

If you saved the configuration to the clipboard, go to the (config) prompt and
paste the configuration into the terminal.

•

If you saved the configuration on the FTP server:
At the enable command prompt, enter the following command:
SGOS# configure network “url”

where url must be in quotes and is fully-qualified (including the protocol, server
name or IP address, path, and filename of the configuration file). The
configuration file is downloaded from the server, and the SG appliance settings
are updated.
Note: If you rename the archived configuration file so that it does not contain
any spaces, the quotes surrounding the URL are unnecessary.

The username and password used to connect to the FTP server can be embedded
into the URL. The format of the URL is:
ftp://username:password@ftp-server

47

Volume 1: Getting Started

where ftp-server is either the IP address or the DNS resolvable hostname of the
FTP server.
If you do not specify a username and password, the SG appliance assumes that an
anonymous FTP is desired and thus sends the following as the credentials to
connect to the FTP server:
username: anonymous
password: proxy@

Archiving a Configuration
In the rare case of a complete system failure, restoring a SG appliance to its previous state
is simplified by loading an archived system configuration from an FTP or TFTP server.
The archive, taken from the running configuration, contains all system settings differing
from system defaults, along with any installable lists configured on the SG appliance.
Archive and restore operations must be done through the CLI.
Note: You can archive a system configuration to an FTP or TFTP server that allows
either anonymous logon or requires a specific username and password. Likewise, to
restore a system configuration, the server storing the archive can be configured either to
allow anonymous logon or to require a username and password.

To prepare to archive a system configuration
1.

Obtain write permission to a directory on an FTP server. This is where the archive will
be stored.
The system configuration must be stored using FTP.

2.

At the (config) command prompt, enter the following commands:
SGOS#(config) archive-configuration protocol {ftp | tftp}
SGOS#(config) archive-configuration host hostname

where hostname is the IP address of the server.
Note: TFTP does not require a password, path, or username.
SGOS#(config) archive-configuration password password
-orSGOS#(config) archive-configuration encrypted-password encryptedpassword

where password is the password (or encrypted password) used to access the server.
SGOS#(config) archive-configuration path path

where path is the directory on the server where the archive is to be stored, relative to
the preset FTP directory.
SGOS#(config) archive-configuration filename-prefix filename

where filename can contain % strings that represent the information in the upload
filename. If you do not use the filename command, the SG appliance creates a name
with a timestamp and the filename SG_last-ip-octet_timestamp. For % string
substitutions, see Volume 8: Access Logging.
SGOS#(config) archive-configuration username username

where user_name is the username used to access the server.

Note: To clear the host, password, or path, type the above commands using empty
double-quotes instead of the variable. For example, to clear the path, enter archiveconfiguration path “”.

To archive a system configuration:
At the enable command prompt, enter the following command:
SGOS# upload configuration

To restore a system configuration:
At the enable command prompt, enter the following command:
SGOS# configure network “url”

See “Sharing Configurations” on page 45 for more information about formatting the URL
for FTP.

Troubleshooting
When pushing a shared configuration or restoring an archived configuration, keep in
mind the following issues:
❐

Encrypted passwords (login, enable, and FTP) cannot be decrypted by a device other
than that on which it was encrypted. If you were sharing a configuration, these
encrypted passwords were probably already created before the configuration was
pushed to the system.

❐

If the content filtering database has not yet been downloaded, any policy that
references categories is not recognized.

❐

The following passwords must be re-created (if you use the application specified):
•

administrator console passwords (not needed for shared configurations)

•

privileged-mode (enable) passwords (not needed for shared configurations)

•

the front-panel PIN (recommended for limiting physical access to the system)

•

access log FTP client passwords (primary, alternate)

•

archive configuration FTP password

•

RADIUS primary and alternate secret

•

LDAP search password

•

SmartFilter download password

•

WebSense3 download password

49

Volume 1: Getting Started

•

SNMP read, write, and trap community strings

•

RADIUS and TACACS+ secrets for splash pages

❐

A full download of the content filtering database must be done.

❐

SSH certificate keys must be imported.

❐

SSL certificate keys must be imported

In addition, you should make sure the system is functioning whenever you add a feature.
For example, make sure the system works after basic configuration; then, after you add
authentication, recheck the system.

Chapter 6: Adapters

This chapter describes SG network adapters and the adapter interfaces; the following
topics are discussed:
❐

“About Adapters” on page 51

❐

“About Virtual LAN Configuration” on page 51

❐

“Configuring an Adapter” on page 54

❐

“Configuring Interface Settings” on page 57

❐

“Detecting Network Adapter Faults” on page 59

About Adapters
SG appliances ship with one or more network adapters installed on the system, each
with one or more interfaces. This chapter describes how to change interface parameters
or configure additional adapters or virtual LANs in the appliance. You can also accept
or reject inbound connections, change link settings in the event the system did not
correctly determine them, and configure the browser for proxy settings.
As you select adapters from the picklist, the Adapter panel (Configuration > Network >
Adapters) displays the state of the configured adapter and its interfaces.
Note: In Blue Coat documentation, the convention for the interface is
adapter.interface. For example, 0:0.

About Virtual LAN Configuration
This section discusses Virtual LAN (VLAN) deployments.

About VLAN Deployments
VLANs are created to group multiple physical network segments into individual
broadcast domains. The benefit to this is that clients can be organized logically—for
example, based on organization—rather than limited to physical connections to
interfaces. Because networks recognize VLANs as they do physical LANs, each VLAN
can have an IP prefix assigned to it. This enables IP routing of traffic flow between
VLANs, which allows for targeted traffic relaying rather than broadcasting to all
connected hosts.
VLAN configuration occurs on the switch. The network administrator specifies which
ports belong to which VLANs. The following diagram illustrates a port-based VLAN
configuration. Clients on network segments attached to switch ports 1 and 2 belong to
VLAN 1, which has the network address 10.0.1.x; network segments attached to
switch ports 14 and 15 belong to VLAN 2, which has the network address 10.0.2.x.

Manually Configuring Link Settings
By default, the SGOS software automatically determines the link settings for all network
adapters. However, Blue Coat strongly recommends manually setting the link settings to
avoid problems.
To manually configure link settings:
1.

Select Configuration > Network > Adapters > Adapters.

2.

Select an adapter from the Adapters drop-down list.

3.

Click Settings.

4.

Select Manually configure link settings.

5.

Select Half or Full duplex.

6.

Select the correct network speed.

7.

Click OK to close the Advanced Settings dialog.

8.

Click Apply.

Related CLI Syntax to Manually Configure Link Settings
❐

To enter configuration mode for standard interfaces:
SGOS#(config interface adapter:interface) {full-duplex | half-duplex}

Configuring Proxies
To configure proxies, refer to Volume 2: Proxies and Proxy Services.

Detecting Network Adapter Faults
The SG appliance can detect whether the network adapters in an appliance are
functioning properly. If the appliance finds that an adapter is faulty, it stops using it.
When the fault is remedied, the SG appliance detects the functioning adapter and uses it
normally.
To determine whether an adapter is functioning properly:
1.

Check whether the link is active (that is, a cable is connected and both sides are up).

2.

Check the ratio of error packets to good packets: both sent and received.

3.

Check if packets have been sent without any packets received.

59

Volume 1: Getting Started

If an adapter fault is detected and the adapter has an IP address assigned to it, the SG
appliance logs a severe event. When an adapter does not have an IP address, the appliance
does not log an entry.

60

Chapter 7: Software and Hardware Bridges

About the Pass-Through Adapter
A pass-through adapter is a 10/100 dual interface Ethernet adapter designed by Blue Coat
to provide an efficient fault-tolerant bridging solution. If this adapter is installed on an SG
appliance, SGOS detects the adapter upon system bootup and automatically creates a
bridge—the two Ethernet interfaces serve as the bridge ports. If the SG appliance is
powered down or loses power for any reason, the bridge fails open; that is, Web traffic
passes from one Ethernet interface to the other. Therefore, Web traffic is uninterrupted,
but does not route through the appliance.

Important: This scenario creates a security vulnerability.
Once power is restored to the SG appliance, the bridge comes back online and Web traffic
is routed to the appliance and thus is subject to that appliance’s configured features,
policies, content scanning, and redirection instructions. Note that bridging supports only
failover; it does not support load balancing.
Note: The adapter state is displayed on Configuration > Network > Adapters.

Reflecting Link Errors
When the SG appliance is deployed transparently with bridging enabled, link errors that
occur on one interface can be reflected to the other bridge interface. This allows a router
connected to the SG appliance on the healthy link to detect this failure and recompute a
path around this failed segment. When the interface with the original link error is brought
back up, the other interface is automatically restarted as part of the health check process.
Reflecting link errors requires that two interfaces be available and connected in a bridging
configuration; it also requires that the propagation-failure option is enabled. By
default, propagation-failure is disabled.
Note: This feature is only applicable to a two-interface hardware or software bridge.
The propagation-failure option sets itself to disabled in any other scenario.

If the link goes down while propagation-failure is disabled, the previous link state is
immediately reflected to the other interface if propagation-failure is enabled during
this time.

Configuring a Software Bridge
This section describes how to use the Management Console or the CLI to link adapters
and interfaces to create a network bridge.
Before configuring a software bridge, ensure that your adapters are of the same type.
Although the software does not restrict you from configuring bridges with adapters of
different speeds (10/100 or GIGE, for example), the resulting behavior is unpredictable.
To create and configure a software bridge:
1.

Select Configuration > Network > Adapters > Bridges.

2.

Click New.

Chapter 7: Software and Hardware Bridges

❐

Selecting a failover mode (parallel or serial).

Both proxies can have the same priority (for example, the default priority). In that case,
priority is determined by the local IP address—the SG appliance with the highest local IP
will assume the role of master.
Example
The following example creates a bridging configuration with one bridge on standby.
Note: This deployment requires a hub on both sides of the bridge or a switch
capable of interface mirroring.
❐

SG A—software bridge IP address: 10.0.0.2. Create a virtual IP address and a
failover group, and designate this group the master.
SG_A#(config) virtual-ip address 10.0.0.4
SG_A#(config) failover
SG_A#(config failover) create 10.0.0.4
SG_A#(config failover) edit 10.0.0.4
SG_A#(config failover 10.0.0.4) master
SG_A#(config failover 10.0.0.4) enable

The preceding commands create a failover group called 10.0.0.4. The priority is
automatically set to 254 and the failover interval is set to 40.
❐

SG B—software bridge IP address: 10.0.0.3. Create a virtual IP address and a
failover group.
SG_B#(config) virtual-ip address 10.0.0.4
SG_B#(config) failover
SG_B#(config failover) create 10.0.0.4
SG_B#(config failover) edit 10.0.0.4
SG_B#(config failover 10.0.0.4) enable
In the bridge configuration on each SG appliance, attach the bridge
configuration to the failover group:
SG_A#(config bridge bridge_name) failover group 10.0.0.4
SG_B#(config bridge bridge_name) failover group 10.0.0.4

❐

Specify the failover mode:
SG_A#(config bridge bridge_name) failover mode serial
SG_B#(config bridge bridge_name) failover mode serial

Bridging Loop Detection
Bridging now supports the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP). STP is a link management
protocol that prevents bridge loops in a network that has redundant paths that can cause
packets to be bridged infinitely without ever being removed from the network.
STP ensures that a bridge, when faced with multiple paths, uses a path that is loop-free. If
that path fails, the algorithm recalculates the network and finds another loop-free path.
The administrator can enable or disable spanning tree participation for the interface.

Chapter 8: Gateways

A key feature of the SGOS software is the ability to distribute traffic originating at the
appliance through multiple gateways. You can also fine tune how the traffic is
distributed to different gateways. This feature works with any routing protocol (such as
static routes or RIP).
Note: Load balancing through multiple gateways is independent from the perinterface load balancing the SG appliance automatically does when more than
one network interface is installed.

This chapter discusses:

About Gateways
During the initial setup of the SG appliance, you optionally defined a gateway (a device
that serves as entrance and exit into a communications network) for the SG appliance.
By using multiple gateways, an administrator can assign a number of available
gateways into a preference group and configure the load distribution to the gateways
within the group. Multiple preference groups are supported.
The gateway specified applies to all network adapters in the system.

SG Appliance Specifics
Which gateway the SG appliance chooses to use at a given time is determined by how
the administrator configures the assignment of preference groups to default gateways.
You can define multiple gateways within the same preference group. A SG appliance
can have from 1 to 10 preference groups. If you have only one gateway, it automatically
has a weight of 100.
Initially, all gateways in the lowest preference group are considered to be the active
gateways. If a gateway becomes unreachable, it is dropped from the active gateway list,
but the remaining gateways within the group continue to be used until they all become
unreachable, or until an unreachable gateway in a lower preference group becomes
reachable again. If all gateways in the lowest preference group become unreachable, the
gateways in the next lowest preference group become the active gateways.

73

Chapter 8: Gateways

Note: If your environment uses explicit proxy or Layer-4 redirection, or if the
destination IP addresses cannot be verified by the SG appliance, static routes must be
configured.

Hardware or software bridges can be transparently routed if the destination IP address/
hostname can be verified. If the client-provided destination IP address is not in the list of
resolved IP addresses for the particular host, then the SG appliance uses static routes
instead. For hostname-less protocols such as CIFS and FTP, the IP address can always be
trusted. For other protocols, such as HTTP, RTSP, and MMS, which have a hostname that
must be resolved, verification can be an issue. URL rewrites that modify the hostname
also can cause verification to fail.
Transparent ADN connections that are handed off to an application proxy (HTTP or
MAPI, for example) can utilize L2/L3 transparency. Also, transparent ADN connections
that are tunneled but not handed off can utilize the functionality.
Note: IM is not supported with trust client addressing. In order to login and chat,
the default router must have Internet access. Other IM features require direct
connections, so static routes are required.

This feature is not user-configurable.

Using Static Routes
If you use an explicit proxy or layer-4 redirection deployment, or a Blue Coat feature such
as forwarding where the destination IP cannot be verified by the SG appliance, you can
use static routes.
A static route is a manually-configured route that specifies the transmission path a packet
must follow, based on the packet’s destination address. A static route specifies a
transmission path to another network, and a default static route already exists.
Situations in which static routes are used include:
❐

DNS load balancing. Sites that use DNS load balancing and return a single IP address
cause a mismatch between the IP address provided by the client and the IP address
resolved by the SG appliance.

❐

Anywhere that appropriate client-side routing information is unavailable, such as for
forwarding hosts, dynamic categorization, and ADN peers.
Note:

For bridged deployments, transparent routing, in most cases, overrides any
static route lookups.
The routing table is a text file containing a list of IP addresses, subnet masks, and
gateways. You are limited to 10,000 entries in the static routes table. The following is a
sample router table:
10.25.36.0
10.25.37.0
10.25.38.0

255.255.255.0
255.255.255.0
255.255.255.0

10.25.36.1
10.25.37.1
10.25.38.1

When a routing table is installed, all requested URLs are compared to the list and routed
based on the best match.

75

Volume 1: Getting Started

You can install the routing table several ways.
❐

Using the Text Editor, which allows you to enter settings (or copy and paste the
contents of an already-created file) directly onto the appliance.

❐

Creating a local file on your local system; the SG appliance can browse to the file and
install it.

❐

Using a remote URL, where you place an already-created file on an FTP or HTTP
server to be downloaded to the SG appliance.

❐

Using the CLI inline static-route-table command, which allows you to paste a
static route table into the SG appliance.

❐

Using the CLI static-routes command, which requires that you place an alreadycreated file on an FTP or HTTP server and enter the URL into the SG appliance.

Note: If you upgrade to SGOS 5.x from SGOS 4.x, entries from the central and local
bypass lists are converted to static route entries in the static route table. The converted
static route entries are appended after the existing static route entries. Duplicate static
route entries are silently ignored.

All traffic leaving the SG appliance is affected by the static route entries created from the
SGOS 4.x bypass lists.

Any deployment that causes traffic to traverse the link from the SG appliance to the
home router twice is not supported. Some WCCP configurations might not work as
expected.

❐

If you use URL host rewrite functionality in your policies, mismatches can occur
between the client-provided IP address and the resolved, rewritten hostname. In these
cases, static routing is used.

Chapter 9: DNS

During first-time installation of the SG appliance, you configured the IP address of a
single primary Domain Name Service (DNS) server. Using the Configuration > Network
> DNS tab, you can change this primary DNS server at any time, and you can also
define additional primary DNS servers and one or more alternate DNS servers.

“Caching Negative Responses” on page 82

SG Appliance Specifics
If you have defined more than one DNS server, the SGOS software uses the following
logic to determine which servers are used to resolve a DNS host name and when to
return an error to the client:
❐

SGOS first sends requests to DNS servers in the primary DNS server list.

❐

Servers are always contacted in the order in which they appear in a list.

❐

The next server in a list is only contacted if the SG appliance does not receive a
response from the current server.

❐

If none of the servers in a list returns a response, the SG appliance returns an error
to the client.

❐

The SG appliance only sends requests to servers in the alternate DNS server list if a
server in the primary list indicates that a DNS host name cannot be resolved.
If a DNS server returns any other error (other than an indication that a DNS host
name could not be resolved), the SG appliance returns the error to the client.
If a server in both the primary and alternate DNS server lists are unable to resolve a
DNS host name, an error is returned to the client.

The SG appliance always attempts to contact the first server in the primary DNS server.
If a response is received from this server, no attempts are made to contact any other
DNS servers in the primary list.
If the response from the first primary DNS server indicates a name error, the SG
appliance sends a DNS request to the first alternate DNS server, if one is defined. If no
alternate DNS servers have been defined, an error is returned to the client indicating a
name error. If the first alternate DNS server is unable to resolve the IP address, a name
error is returned to the client, and no attempt is made to contact any other DNS servers
in either the primary or alternate DNS server lists.

79

Volume 1: Getting Started

Unresolved Hostnames (Name Imputing)
Name imputing allows the SG appliance to resolve host names based on a partial name
specification. When the SG appliance submits a host name to the DNS server, the DNS
server resolves the name to an IP address. The SG appliance queries the original hostname
before checking imputing entries unless there is no period in the host name, in which case
imputing is applied first. The SG appliance tries each entry in the name-imputing list until
the name is resolved or it comes to the end of the list. If by the end of the list the name is
not resolved, the SG appliance returns a DNS failure.
For example, if the name-imputing list contains the entries company.com and com, and a
user submits the URL http://www.eedept, the SG appliance resolves the host names in
the following order.
http://www.eedept
http://www.eedept.company.com
http://www.eedept.com

To add names to the imputing list:
1.

Select Configuration > Network > DNS > Imputing.
The Imputing tab displays.

2.

Click New to add a new name to the imputing list.

3.

Enter the name in the dialog that appears and click OK.

4.

Select Apply to commit the changes to the SG appliance.

Related CLI Syntax to Add Names to the Imputing List
To add names to the imputing list:
SGOS#(config) dns imputing suffix

For example, to use company.com as the imputing suffix, enter dns-imputing
company.com.
Repeat until all imputing suffixes have been entered.

Changing the Order of DNS Name Imputing Suffixes
The SG appliance uses imputing suffixes in the order displayed. You can organize the list
of suffixes so the preferred suffix appears at the top of the list. This functionality is only
available through the Management Console. You cannot configure it through the CLI.
To change the order of DNS name imputing suffixes:
1.

Select Configuration > Network > DNS > Imputing.
The Imputing tab displays.

2.

Select the imputing suffix to promote or demote.

3.

Click Promote entry or Demote entry as appropriate.

4.

Select Apply to commit the changes to the SG appliance.

Caching Negative Responses
By default, the SG appliance caches negative DNS responses sent by a DNS server. You
can configure the SG appliance to set the time-to-live (TTL) value for a negative DNS
response to be cached. You can also disable negative DNS response caching.

82

Chapter 9: DNS

Note: The SG appliance generates more DNS requests when negative caching is

disabled.
The SG appliance supports caching of both type A and type PTR DNS negative responses.
This functionality is only available through the CLI. You cannot configure DNS negative
caching through the Management Console.
To configure negative caching TTL values:
From the (config) prompt:
SGOS#(config) dns negative-cache-ttl-override seconds

where seconds is any integer between 0 and 600.
Setting the TTL value to 0 seconds disables negative DNS caching; setting the TTL setting
to a non-zero value overrides the TTL value from the DNS response.
To restore negative caching defaults:
From the (config) prompt):
SGOS#(config) dns no negative-cache-ttl-override

appliances).

ADN optimize attribute

Controls whether to optimize bandwidth usage when connecting upstream using an
ADN tunnel.

asx rewrite

A log that provides a record of who accessed what and how.

85

Volume 1: Getting Started

authenticate-401 attribute

All transparent and explicit requests received on the port always use transparent
authentication (cookie or IP, depending on the configuration). This is especially
useful to force transparent proxy authentication in some proxy-chaining scenarios

authenticated content

Cached content that requires authentication at the origin content server (OCS).
Supported authentication types for cached data include basic authentication and
IWA (or NTLM).

authentication

Allows you to verify the identity of a user. In its simplest form, this is done through
usernames and passwords. Much more stringent authentication can be employed
using digital certificates that have been issued and verified by a Certificate Authority.
See also basic authentication, proxy authentication, and SSL authentication.

authentication realm

Authenticates and authorizes users to access SG services using either explicit proxy
or transparent proxy mode. These realms integrate third-party vendors, such as
LDAP, Windows, and Novell, with the Blue Coat operating system.

authorization

The permissions given to an authenticated user.

B
bandwidth class

A defined unit of bandwidth allocation.

Bandwidth classes can be grouped together in a class hierarchy, which is a tree
structure that specifies the relationship among different classes. You create a
hierarchy by creating at least one parent class and assigning other classes to be its
children.

bandwidth management

Classify, control, and, if needed, limit the amount of bandwidth used by network
traffic flowing in or out of an SG appliance.

basic authentication

The standard authentication for communicating with the target as identified in the
URL.

BCAAA

Blue Coat Authentication and Authorization Agent. Allows SGOS 5.x to manage

separately from SGOS 5.x and is available from the Blue Coat Web site.

BCLP

Blue Coat Licensing Portal.

byte-range support

The ability of the SG appliance to respond to byte-range requests (requests with a
Range: HTTP header).

C
cache

An "object store," either hardware or software, that stores information (objects) for
later retrieval. The first time the object is requested, it is stored, making subsequent
requests for the same information much faster.
A cache helps reduce the response time and network bandwidth consumption on
future, equivalent requests. The SG appliance serves as a cache by storing content
from many users to minimize response time and prevent extraneous network traffic.

cache control

Allows you to configure which content the SG appliance stores.

86

Appendix A: Glossary

cache efficiency

A tab found on the Statistics pages of the Management Console that shows the
percent of objects served from cache, the percent loaded from the network, and the
percent that were non-cacheable.

cache hit

Occurs when the SG appliance receives a request for an object and can serve the
request from the cache without a trip to the origin server.

cache miss

Occurs when the appliance receives a request for an object that is not in the cache.
The appliance must then fetch the requested object from the origin server. .

cache object

Cache contents includes all objects currently stored by the SG appliance. Cache
objects are not cleared when the SG appliance is powered off.

Certificate Authority (CA)

A trusted, third-party organization or company that issues digital certificates used to
create digital signatures and public key/private key pairs. The role of the CA is to
guarantee that the individuals or company representatives who are granted a unique
certificate are who they claim to be.

child class (bandwidth gain)

The child of a parent class is dependent upon that parent class for available
bandwidth (they share the bandwidth in proportion to their minimum/maximum
bandwidth values and priority levels). A child class with siblings (classes with the
same parent class) shares bandwidth with those siblings in the same manner.

client consent certificates

A certificate that indicates acceptance or denial of consent to decrypt an end user's
HTTPS request.

client-side transparency

A way of replacing the appliance IP address with the Web server IP address for all
port 80 traffic destined to go to the client. This effectively conceals the SG appliance
address from the client and conceals the identity of the client from the Web server.

concentrator

An SG appliance, usually located in a data center, that provides access to data center
resources, such as file servers.

content filtering

A way of controlling which content is delivered to certain users. SG appliances can
filter content based on content categories (such as gambling, games, and so on), type
(such as http, ftp, streaming, and mime type), identity (user, group, network), or
network conditions. You can filter content using vendor-based filtering or by
allowing or denying access to URLs.

D
default boot system

The system that was successfully started last time. If a system fails to boot, the next
most recent system that booted successfully becomes the default boot system.

default proxy listener

See proxy service (d efault).

denial of service (DoS)

A method that hackers use to prevent or deny legitimate users access to a computer,
such as a Web server. DoS attacks typically send many request packets to a targeted
Internet server, flooding the server's resources and making the system unusable. Any
system connected to the Internet and equipped with TCP-based network services is
vulnerable to a DoS attack.
The SG appliance resists DoS attacks launched by many common DoS tools. With a
hardened TCP/IP stack, SG appliance resists common network attacks, including
traffic flooding.

87

detect protocol attribute

Detects the protocol being used. Protocols that can be detected include: HTTP, P2P
(eDonkey, BitTorrent, FastTrack, Gnutella), SSL, and Endpoint Mapper.

diagnostic reporting

Found in the Statistics pane, the Diagnostics tab allows you to control whether Daily
Heartbeats and/or Blue Coat Monitoring are enabled or disabled.

directives

Commands used in installable lists to configure forwarding and SOCKS gateway.

DNS access

A policy layer that determines how the SG appliance processes DNS requests.

domain name system (DNS)

An Internet service that translates domain names into IP addresses. See also private
DNS or public DNS.

dynamic bypass

Provides a maintenance-free method for improving performance of the SG appliance
by automatically compiling a list of requested URLs that return various kinds of
errors.

dynamic real-time rating
(DRTR)

Used in conjunction with the Blue Coat Web Filter (BCWF), DRTR (also known as
dynamic categorization) provides real-time analysis and content categorization of
requested Web pages to solve the problem of new and previously unknown
uncategorized URLs—those not in the database. When a user requests a URL that has
not already been categorized by the BCWF database (for example, a brand new Web
site), the SG appliance dynamic categorization service analyzes elements of the
requested content and assigns a category or categories. The dynamic service is
consulted only when the installed BCWF database does not contain category
information for an object.

E
early intercept attribute

Controls whether the proxy responds to client TCP connection requests before
connecting to the upstream server. When early intercept is disabled, the proxy delays
responding to the client until after it has attempted to contact the server.

ELFF-compatible format

A log type defined by the W3C that is general enough to be used with any protocol.

emulated certificates

Certificates that are presented to the user by SG appliance when intercepting HTTPS
requests. Blue Coat emulates the certificate from the server and signs it, copying the
subjectName and expiration. The original certificate is used between the SG
appliance and the server.

encrypted log

A log is encrypted using an external certificate associated with a private key.
Encrypted logs can only be decrypted by someone with access to the private key. The
private key is not accessible to the SG appliance.

EULA

End user license agreement.

event logging

Allows you to specify the types of system events logged, the size of the event log, and
to configure Syslog monitoring. The appliance can also notify you by email if an
event is logged. See also access logging.

88

Appendix A: Glossary

explicit proxy

A configuration in which the browser is explicitly configured to communicate with
the proxy server for access to content.
This is the default for the SG appliance, and requires configuration for both browser
and the interface card.

extended log file format
(ELFF)

A variant of the common log file format, which has two additional fields at the end of
the line—the referer and the user agent fields.

F
fail open/closed

Failing open or closed applies to forwarding hosts and groups and SOCKS gateways.
Fail open or closed applies when health checks are showing sick for each forwarding
or SOCKS gateway target in the applicable fail-over sequence. If no systems are
healthy, the SG appliance fails open or closed, depending on the configuration. If
closed, the connection attempt simply fails.
If open, an attempt is made to connect without using any forwarding target (or
SOCKS gateway). Fail open is usually a security risk; fail closed is the default if no
setting is specified.

filtering

See content filtering.

forward proxy

A proxy server deployed close to the clients and used to access many servers. A
forward proxy can be explicit or transparent.

FTP

See Native FTP; Web FTP.

G
gateway

A device that serves as entrance and exit into a communications network.

H
hardware serial number

A string that uniquely identifies the appliance; it is assigned to each unit in
manufacturing.

health check tests

The method of determining network connectivity, target responsiveness, and basic
functionality. The following tests are supported:
• ICMP
• TCP
• SSL
• HTTP
• HTTPS
• Group
• Composite and reference to a composite result

health check type

The kind of device or service the specific health check tests. The following types are
supported:
• Forwarding host and forwarding group
• SOCKS gateway and SOCKS gateway group
• CAP service and ICAP service group
• Websense off-box service and Websense off-box service group
• DRTR rating service
• User-defined host and a user-defined composite

heartbeat

Messages sent once every 24 hours that contain the statistical and configuration data
for the SG appliance, indicating its health. Heartbeats are commonly sent to system
administrators and to Blue Coat. Heartbeats contain no private information, only
aggregate statistics useful for pre-emptively diagnosing support issues.
The SG appliance sends emergency heartbeats whenever it is rebooted. Emergency
heartbeats contain core dump and restart flags in addition to daily heartbeat
information.

host affinity

The attempt to direct multiple connections by a single user to the same group
member. Host affinity is closely tied to load balancing behavior; both should be
configured if load balancing is important.

host affinity timeout

The host affinity timeout determines how long a user remains idle before the
connection is closed. The timeout value checks the user's IP address, SSL ID, or
cookie in the host affinity table.

I
inbound traffic (bandwidth
gain)

Network packets flowing into the SG appliance. Inbound traffic mainly consists of
the following:
• Server inbound: Packets originating at the origin content server (OCS) and sent to
the SG appliance to load a Web object.
• Client inbound: Packets originating at the client and sent to the SG appliance for
Web requests.

installable lists

Installable lists, comprised of directives, can be placed onto the SG appliance in one
of the following ways:
• Creating the list using the SG text editor
• Placing the list at an accessible URL
• Downloading the directives file from the local system

integrated host timeout

An integrated host is an origin content server (OCS) that has been added to the health
check list. The host, added through the integrate_new_hosts property, ages out
of the integrated host table after being idle for the specified time. The default is 60
minutes.

intervals

Time period from the completion of one health check to the start of the next health
check.

IP reflection

Determines how the client IP address is presented to the origin server for explicitly
proxied requests. All proxy services contain a reflect-ip attribute, which enables or
disables sending of client's IP address instead of the SG's IP address.

The keyring used by the SG appliance to sign emulated certificates. The keyring is
configured on the appliance and managed through policy.

L
licensable component (LC)

(Software) A subcomponent of a license; it is an option that enables or disables a
specific feature.

license

Provides both the right and the ability to use certain software functions within an AV
(or SG) appliance. The license key defines and controls the license, which is owned
by an account.

listener

The service that is listening on a specific port. A listener can be identified by any
destination IP/subnet and port range. Multiple listeners can be added to each
service.

live content

Also called live broadcast. Used in streaming, it indicates that the content is being
delivered fresh.

LKF

License key file.

load balancing

A way to share traffic requests among multiple upstream systems or multiple IP
addresses on a single host.

local bypass list

A list you create and maintain on your network. You can use a local bypass list alone
or in conjunction with a central bypass list. See bypass list.

local policy file

Written by enterprises (as opposed to the central policy file written by Blue Coat);
used to create company- and department-specific advanced policies written in the
Blue Coat Policy Language (CPL).

log facility

A separate log that contains a single logical file and supports a single log format. It
also contains the file’s configuration and upload schedule information as well as
other configurable information such as how often to rotate (switch to a new log) the
logs at the destination, any passwords needed, and the point at which the facility can
be uploaded.

log format

The type of log that is used: NCSA/Common, SQUID, ELFF, SurfControl, or
Websense.
The proprietary log types each have a corresponding pre-defined log format that has
been set up to produce exactly that type of log (these logs cannot be edited). In
addition, a number of other ELFF type log formats are also pre-defined (im, main,
p2p, ssl, streaming). These can be edited, but they start out with a useful set of log
fields for logging particular protocols understood by the SG appliance. It is also
possible to create new log formats of type ELFF or Custom which can contain any
desired combination of log fields.

log tail

The access log tail shows the log entries as they get logged. With high traffic on the
SG appliance, not all access log entries are necessarily displayed. However, you can
view all access log information after uploading the log.

M
MACH5

SGOS 5 MACH5 Edition.

91

Volume 1: Getting Started

Management Console

A graphical Web interface that lets you to manage, configure, monitor, and upgrade
the SG appliance from any location. The Management Console consists of a set of
Web pages and Java applets stored on the SG appliance. The appliance acts as a Web
server on the management port to serve these pages and applets.

management information
base (MIB)

Defines the statistics that management systems can collect. A managed device
(gateway) has one or more MIBs as well as one or more SNMP agents, which
implements the information and management functionality defined by a specific
MIB.

maximum object size

The maximum object size stored in the SG appliance. All objects retrieved that are
greater than the maximum size are delivered to the client but are not stored in the SG
appliance.

MIME/FILE type filtering

Allows organizations to implement Internet policies for both uploaded and
downloaded content by MIME or FILE type.

multi-bit rate

The capability of a single stream to deliver multiple bit rates to clients requesting
content from appliances from within varying levels of network conditions (such as
different connecting bandwidths and traffic).

multicast

Used in streaming; the ability for hundreds or thousands of users to play a single
stream.

multicast aliases

Used in streaming; a streaming command that specifies an alias for a multicast URL
to receive an .nsc file. The .nsc files allows the multicast session to obtain the
information in the control channel

multicast station

Used in streaming; a defined location on the proxy where the Windows Media player
can retrieve streams. A multicast station enables multicast transmission of Windows
Media content from the cache. The source of the multicast-delivered content can be a
unicast-live source, a multicast (live) source, and simulated live (video-on-demand
content converted to scheduled live content).

multimedia content services

Used in streaming; multimedia support includes Real Networks, Microsoft Windows
Media, Apple QuickTime, MP3, and Flash.

N
name inputing

Allows an SG appliance to resolve host names based on a partial name specification.
When a host name is submitted to the DNS server, the DNS server resolves the name
to an IP address. If the host name cannot be resolved, Blue Coat adds the first entry in
the name-inputing list to the end of the host name and resubmits it to the DNS server

native FTP

Native FTP involves the client connecting (either explicitly or transparently) using
the FTP protocol; the SG appliance then connects upstream through FTP (if
necessary).

NCSA common log format

Blue Coat products are compatible with this log type, which contains only basic
HTTP access information.

network address translation
(NAT)

The process of translating private network (such as intranet) IP addresses to Internet
IP addresses and vice versa. This methodology makes it possible to match private IP
addresses to Internet IP addresses even when the number of private addresses
outnumbers the pool of available Internet addresses.

92

Appendix A: Glossary

non-cacheable objects

A number of objects are not cached by the Blue Coat appliance because they are
considered non-cacheable. You can add or delete the kinds of objects that the
appliance considers non-cacheable. Some of the non-cacheable request types are:
• Pragma no-cache, requests that specify non-cached objects, such as when you click
refresh in the Web browser.
• Password provided, requests that include a client password.
• Data in request that include additional client data.
• Not a GET request.

.nsc file

Created from the multicast station definition and saved through the browser as a text
file encoded in a Microsoft proprietary format. Without an .nsc file, the multicast
station definition does not work.

NTP

To manage objects in an appliance, an SG appliance must know the current Universal
Time Coordinates (UTC) time. By default, the SG appliance attempts to connect to a
Network Time Protocol (NTP) server to acquire the UTC time. SG appliance includes
a list of NTP servers available on the Internet, and attempts to connect to them in the
order they appear in the NTP server list on the NTP tab.

O
object (used in caching)

An object is the item that is stored in an appliance. These objects can be frequently
accessed content, content that has been placed there by content publishers, or Web
pages, among other things.

object (used in Visual Policy
Manager)

An object (sometimes referred to as a condition) is any collection or combination of
entry types you can create individually (user, group, IP address/subnet, and
attribute). To be included in an object, an item must already be created as an
individual entry.

object pipelining

This patented algorithm opens as many simultaneous TCP connections as the origin
server will allow and retrieves objects in parallel. The objects are then delivered from
the appliance straight to the user's desktop as fast as the browser can request them.

origin content server (OCS)

Also called origin server. This is the original source of the content that is being
requested. An appliance needs the OCS to acquire data the first time, to check that
the content being served is still fresh, and to authenticate users.

outbound traffic (bandwidth
gain)

Network packets flowing out of the SG appliance. Outbound traffic mainly consists
of the following:
• Client outbound: Packets sent to the client in response to a Web request.
• Server outbound: Packets sent to an OCS or upstream proxy to request a service.

P
PAC (Proxy
AutoConfiguration) scripts

Originally created by Netscape, PACs are a way to avoid requiring proxy hosts and
port numbers to be entered for every protocol. You need only enter the URL. A PAC
can be created with the needed information and the local browser can be directed to
the PAC for information about proxy hosts and port numbers.

packet capture (PCAP)

Allows filtering on various attributes of the Ethernet frame to limit the amount of
data collected. You can capture packets of Ethernet frames going into or leaving an
SG appliance.

93

Volume 1: Getting Started

parent class (bandwidth
gain)

A class with at least one child. The parent class must share its bandwidth with its
child classes in proportion to the minimum/maximum bandwidth values or priority
levels.

passive mode data
connections (PASV)

Data connections initiated by an FTP client to an FTP server.

pipelining

See object pipelining.

policies

Groups of rules that let you manage Web access specific to the needs of an enterprise.
Policies enhance SG appliance feature areas such as authentication and virus
scanning, and let you control end-user Web access in your existing infrastructure.
See also refresh policies.

policy-based bypass list

Used in policy. Allows a bypass based on the properties of the client, unlike static and
dynamic bypass lists, which allow traffic to bypass the appliance based on
destination IP address. See also bypass lists and dynamic bypass.

policy layer

A collection of rules created using Blue Coat CPL or with the VPM.

pragma: no cache (PNC)

A metatag in the header of a request that requires the appliance to forward a request
to the origin server. This allows clients to always obtain a fresh copy (of the request?).

proxy

Caches content, filters traffic, monitors Internet and intranet resource usage, blocks
specific Internet and intranet resources for individuals or groups, and enhances the
quality of Internet or intranet user experiences.
A proxy can also serve as an intermediary between a Web client and a Web server
and can require authentication to allow identity based policy and logging for the
client.
The rules used to authenticate a client are based on the policies you create on the SG
appliance, which can reference an existing security infrastructure—LDAP, RADIUS,
IWA, and the like.

Proxy Edition

SGOS 5 Proxy Edition.

proxy service

The proxy service defines the ports, as well as other attributes. that are used by the
proxies associated with the service.

proxy service (default)

The default proxy service is a service that intercepts all traffic not otherwise
intercepted by other listeners. It only has one listener whose action can be set to
bypass or intercept. No new listeners can be added to the default proxy service, and
the default listener and service cannot be deleted. Service attributes can be changed.

public key certificate

An electronic document that encapsulates the public key of the certificate sender,
identifies this sender, and aids the certificate receiver to verify the identity of the
certificate sender. A certificate is often considered valid if it has been digitally signed
by a well-known entity, which is called a Certificate Authority (such as VeriSign).

public virtual IP (VIP)

Maps multiple servers to one IP address and then propagates that information to the
public DNS servers. Typically, there is a public VIP known to the public Internet that
routes the packets internally to the private VIP. This enables you to “hide” your
servers from the Internet.

94

Appendix A: Glossary

R
real-time streaming protocol
(RTSP)

A standard method of transferring audio and video and other time-based media over
Internet-technology based networks. The protocol is used to stream clips to any RTPbased client.

reflect client IP attribute

Enables the sending of the client's IP address instead of the SG's IP address to the
upstream server. If you are using an application delivery network (ADN), this setting
is enforced on the concentrator proxy through the Configuration > App. Delivery
Network > Tunneling tab.

registration

An event that binds the appliance to an account, that is, it creates the Serial#, Account
association.

remote authentication dialin user service (RADIUS)

Authenticates user identity via passwords for network access.

reverse proxy

A proxy that acts as a front-end to a small number of pre-defined servers, typically to
improve performance. Many clients can use it to access the small number of
predefined servers.

routing information protocol
(RIP)

Designed to select the fastest route to a destination. RIP support is built into Blue
Coat appliances.

router hops

The number of jumps a packet takes when traversing the Internet.

S
secure shell (SSH)

Also known as Secure Socket Shell. SSH is an interface and protocol that provides
strong authentication and enables you to securely access a remote computer. Three
utilities—login, ssh, and scp—comprise SSH. Security via SSH is accomplished using
a digital certificate and password encryption. Remember that the Blue Coat SG
appliance requires SSH1. An SG appliance supports a combined maximum of 16
Telnet and SSH sessions.

serial console

A third-party device that can be connected to one or more Blue Coat appliances.
Once connected, you can access and configure the appliance through the serial
console, even when you cannot access the appliance directly.

server certificate categories

The hostname in a server certificate can be categorized by BCWF or another content
filtering vendor to fit into categories such as banking, finance, sports.

server portals

Doorways that provide controlled access to a Web server or a collection of Web
servers. You can configure Blue Coat SG appliances to be server portals by mapping a
set of external URLs onto a set of internal URLs.

server-side transparency

The ability for the server to see client IP addresses, which enables accurate clientaccess records to be kept. When server-side transparency is enabled, the appliance
retains client IP addresses for all port 80 traffic to and from the SG appliance. In this
scheme, the client IP address is always revealed to the server.

service attributes

Define the parameters, such as explicit or transparent, cipher suite, and certificate
verification, that the SG appliance uses for a particular service. .

95

Volume 1: Getting Started

SG appliance

A Blue Coat security and cache box that can help manage security and content on a
network.

sibling class (bandwidth
gain)

A bandwidth class with the same parent class as another class.

simple network
management protocol
(SNMP)

The standard operations and maintenance protocol for the Internet. It uses MIBs,
created or customized by Blue Coat, to handle (needs completion).

simulated live

Used in streaming. Defines playback of one or more video-on-demand files as a
scheduled live event, which begins at a specified time. The content can be looped
multiple times, or scheduled to start at multiple start times throughout the day.

SmartReporter log type

A proprietary ELFF log type that is compatible with the SmartFilter SmartReporter
tool.

SOCKS

A proxy protocol for TCP/IP-based networking applications that allows users
transparent access across the firewall. If you are using a SOCKS server for the
primary or alternate forwarding gateway, you must specify the appliance’s ID for the
identification protocol used by the SOCKS gateway. The machine ID should be
configured to be the same as the appliance’s name.

SOCKS proxy

A generic way to proxy TCP and UDP protocols. The SG appliance supports both
SOCKSv4/4a and SOCKSv5; however, because of increased username and password
authentication capabilities and compression support, Blue Coat recommends that
you use SOCKS v5.

splash page

Custom message page that displays the first time you start the client browser.

split proxy

Employs co-operative processing at the branch and the core to implement
functionality that is not possible in a standalone proxy. Examples of split proxies
include:
• Mapi Proxy
• SSL Proxy

SQUID-compatible format

A log type that was designed for cache statistics and is compatible with Blue Coat
products.

squid-native log format

The Squid-compatible format contains one line for each request.

SSL authentication

Ensures that communication is with “trusted” sites only. Requires a certificate issued
by a trusted third party (Certificate Authority).

SSL interception

Decrypting SSL connections.

SSL proxy

A proxy that can be used for any SSL traffic (HTTPS or not), in either forward or
reverse proxy mode.

static route

A manually-configured route that specifies the transmission path a packet must
follow, based on the packet’s destination address. A static route specifies a
transmission path to another network.

96

Appendix A: Glossary

statistics

Every Blue Coat appliance keeps statistics of the appliance hardware and the objects
it stores. You can review the general summary, the volume, resources allocated, cache
efficiency, cached contents, and custom URLs generated by the appliance for various
kinds of logs. You can also check the event viewer for every event that occurred since
the appliance booted.

stream

A flow of a single type of data, measured in kilobits per second (Kbps). A stream
could be the sound track to a music video, for example.

SurfControl log type

A proprietary log type that is compatible with the SurfControl reporter tool. The
SurfControl log format includes fully-qualified usernames when an NTLM realm
provides authentication. The simple name is used for all other realm types.

syslog

An event-monitoring scheme that is especially popular in Unix environments. Most
clients using Syslog have multiple devices sending messages to a single Syslog
daemon. This allows viewing a single chronological event log of all of the devices
assigned to the Syslog daemon. The Syslog format is: “Date Time Hostname Event.”

system cache

The software cache on the appliance. When you clear the cache, all objects in the
cache are set to expired. The objects are not immediately removed from memory or
disk, but a subsequent request for any object requested is retrieved from the origin
content server before it is served.

T
time-to-live (TTL) value

Used in any situation where an expiration time is needed. For example, you do not
want authentication to last beyond the current session and also want a failed
command to time out instead of hanging the box forever.

traffic flow
(bandwidth gain)

Also referred to as flow. A set of packets belonging to the same TCP/UDP connection
that terminate at, originate at, or flow through the SG appliance. A single request
from a client involves two separate connections. One of them is from the client to the
SG appliance, and the other is from the SG appliance to the OCS. Within each of
these connections, traffic flows in two directions—in one direction, packets flow out
of the SG appliance (outbound traffic), and in the other direction, packets flow into
the SG (inbound traffic). Connections can come from the client or the server. Thus,
traffic can be classified into one of four types:
• Server inbound
• Server outbound
• Client inbound
• Client outbound
These four traffic flows represent each of the four combinations described above.
Each flow represents a single direction from a single connection.

transmission control
protocol (TCP)

TCP, when used in conjunction with IP (Internet Protocol) enables users to send data,
in the form of message units called packets, between computers over the Internet.
TCP is responsible for tracking and handling, and reassembly of the packets; IP is
responsible for packet delivery.

transparent proxy

A configuration in which traffic is redirected to the SG appliance without the
knowledge of the client browser. No configuration is required on the browser, but
network configuration, such as an L4 switch or a WCCP-compliant router, is
required.

97

Volume 1: Getting Started

trial period

Starting with the first boot, the trial period provides 60 days of free operation. All
features are enabled during this time.

U
unicast alias

Defines an name on the appliance for a streaming URL. When a client requests the
alias content on the appliance, the appliance uses the URL specified in the unicastalias command to request the content from the origin streaming server.

universal time coordinates
(UTC)

An SG appliance must know the current UTC time. By default, the appliance
attempts to connect to a Network Time Protocol (NTP) server to acquire the UTC
time. If the SG appliance cannot access any NTP servers, you must manually set the
UTC time.

URL filtering

See content filtering.

URL rewrite rules

Rewrite the URLs of client requests to acquire the streaming content using the new
URL. For example, when a client tries to access content on www.mycompany.com,
the appliance is actually receiving the content from the server on 10.253.123.123. The
client is unaware that mycompany.com is not serving the content; however, the
appliance access logs indicate the actual server that provides the content.

W
WCCP

Web Cache Communication Protocol. Allows you to establish redirection of the
traffic that flows through routers.

Web FTP

Web FTP is used when a client connects in explicit mode using HTTP and accesses an
ftp:// URL. The SG appliance translates the HTTP request into an FTP request for the
OCS (if the content is not already cached), and then translates the FTP response with
the file contents into an HTTP response for the client.

Websense log type

A Blue Coat proprietary log type that is compatible with the Websense reporter tool.

X

XML responder

HTTP XML service that runs on an external server.

XML requestor

XML realm.
