MELANIE – Speaker Identification, GMM

Functionality
Speaker identification determines the
probability of a set of speakers in speech
signals.
The algorithm is especially useful when
searching for a certain speaker in mass
audio data.

Training of Models
Goal
Training Data

Training is performed in order to optimise the models on the
respective speaker.
The training data must be labeled according to the prevailing
speaker. If possible, the speaker data should be obtained
from different channels and languages. A minimum of two
minutes speech is required for each speaker.

Technical Data
OperatingSystem Available on Windows XP and Linux
Processing Time

• On a P4; 3GHz, 1GB RAM computer
• 1/8 of real time; i.e. a signal of 8 minutes length is
processed in one minute

Recognition Rate The recognition rate depends on the number of speakers, on
the similarities of the speakers among each other and on the
speech quality.
