ION, the lnternet Operations Network, is the only
vetted and reliable resource that enables online
non-attribution at the most critical level.

ION provides critical capabilities that enable
government organizations to securely collect online
intelligence and defeat the efforts of cybercriminals

Mission Threats in the Cyber Battlespace
Operating on the lnternet presents a real and present danger for government investigations, intelligence
collection, and other mission-critical operations. While some government leaders and decision-makers are
aware of these threats, there still exists a gross misperception that "no one can see what we do online."
The truth is, even simple search engine queries leave digital footprints that can be used by targets for
counterintelligencemeasures.

Anti-virus and firewalls are commonly used tools to protect
organizations from "inbound" threats, but do nothing to
protect government IP addresses during online investigations.
Organizations must protect their "outbound" traffic (IP
addresses) to truly secure their online missions. Without this
critical security component, they put their operations at risk of
the following counteractive measures:

Using simple web analytics, any adversary can capture IP
addresses, allowing them to monitor online activities,
aggregate data, and obtain confidential information
using reverse engineering techniques. Mtection, deterrence,
and exploitation of adversary activities is as important in
cyberspaceas anywhere else.

will experience seamless online data collection with
technologies that allow them to blend in to the general

requires a level of experience and
sophistication that transcends traditional
solutions and providers. ION'S vetted,

turnkey information operation tools for the

Single Network Risk

-

1SPs are limited to providing IP space from only within their
own networks. Solution providers should have the capability
to acquire network space from many independent lSPs
around the globe.

Additional Identification Risks
Simply hiding your IP address is not enough. To ensure
Continuous protection, solutions must constantly monitor
blacklist and blocking sites, provide billions of pages
of cover traffic, and stay completely up-to-date on the
algorithms used for network identification.

Backstopping Penetration Risk
Budget Risk
Solutions that provide subscription-based pricing can help
protect organizations from cost overmns and unforeseen
budgetary impacts.

Extensive, real world operational experience in the selection
~f appropriate backstopping levels must be provided to
ensure the highest level of security. Plausible, appropriate
levels of obfuscation are necessary to mitigate even the
slightest exposure of operations.
