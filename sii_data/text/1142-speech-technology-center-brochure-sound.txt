SOUND CLEANER
Professional real-time, noise cancellation and speech enhancement software

Functional Features
Sound Cleaner is unique software for filtering of
noise-corrupted sound recordings and improvement
of speech intelligibility. The user can adjust the
filtering parameters and hear the changes made in
real-time.
Novices and professionals dealing with corrupted or
noisy speech recordings can use Sound Cleaner
effectively to substantially improve clarity of speech.
Signal is processed by a sequence of modules. There
are 14 typical schemes of processing available; you
may also build customized schemes for noise filtering.
All modules work simultaneously in sequence, and all
options are adjustable in real-time while listening to
the output.

Each process has a separate
window with controls.
All adjustments can be done in
real time, i.e while you are
listening to a recording or live
voice.
There are also 9 adaptive filters
& several other procedures, the
user can use to see waveforms
and FFT spectrum of the source
& processed signals. The user
can make a specific sequence of
processes using only those
methods that s/he needs.
Several windows of the same
process can be created.

Advantages
The main advantage of this compact and user-friendly
software is that it enables the user to input an audio
signal, to listen to it, to process it, to adjust filters
parameters, to store the result on the hard disk or to
record into a cassette SIMULTANEOUSLY!
Sound Cleaner is successfully used both by novices
and professionals

All methods can work simultaneously
Every method may be switched on/off at any
time
Every control may be adjusted in real time
Sound Cleaner can create a report of modules
and settings, used to process a particular record.
Set of processing schemes gives guidance in
defining what noise is present, what modules to
turn on and how to tune them
Effective for both restoration and enhancement of
poor quality records, records made in noisy
environment and real-time sound loaded from an
external source.

The user has the ability to see the waveforms and
FFT spectrums of the source signal and secondly
the processed one.
Playback speed can be increased or decreased up
to 2-3 times without voice pitch distortion or speech
quality losses.
Amplification range is -60...+60dB. When the signal
level after processing drops down, setting a higher
gain value is very useful.
Volume control & pseudo-stereo mode for sound
playback provides for comfortable listening.
Broadband and narrowband noise, stationary and
non-stationary noise can be eliminated completely.
Interferences such as, telephone lines, engine
noise, home/office appliances, industrial
equipment, street, car and aircraft noise, power
supply influence, hum and hiss, room echo and
reverberation, can be eliminated.
Standard multimedia sound card can be used as a
sound source and playback device.
Sound file (*.wav) or analog audio recording can be
processed. The user can listen to the result and
store it to the file simultaneously.
Sound Cleaner is offered as a module in IKAR Lab
- workstation for advanced audio/ speech signal
analysis, processing, noise cancellation, speaker
identification with its core program SIS - Speech
Interactive Software. Caesar - text decoding
software, can also be included in the software set.
The graphic equalizer supports 8192 bands and
has 2048 sliders and allows the user to suppress
narrow bands (2.5 Hz) down 72 dB. The equalizer
can be adjusted to the input sound spectrum
manually and automatically.
The adaptive broadband filter is easy to use. It
cancels the most kinds of home/office equipment
noise. The broadband noise is suppressed down
10-20 dB.
The adaptive inverse filter automatically
suppresses narrowband noise. It is effective for
non-stationary hindrances.
The adaptive frequency compensation uses the
Widrow algorithm in the frequency area. A very
large number of coefficients (8,192) provides the
suppression of many mixed types of noise.
The dynamic processing deals successfully with
the recordings of speech at different volume levels
as well as with other distortions.
The stereo filtering in time (1 method) & frequency
domain (3 methods) provides particular means
against distributed interference (radio, TV, concert,
bar environment) or point-source noise.
