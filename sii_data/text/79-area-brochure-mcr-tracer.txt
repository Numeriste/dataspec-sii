MCRTRACER
MCRTRACER has been developed by AREA to satisfy the upcoming need of LEAs
to track targets movements by means of GPS and GPRS Systems.
MCR Tracer full integration in the MCR Voice & Data Monitoring- Center enables
LEA operators to leverage the power of an unified interface for all the information
(Voice, Data, Positioning) related t o the target.

GEOGRAPHICAL TRACKING OF TARGETS:
A TACTICAL TOOL
The geographical localization of monitored
targets is nowadays one of the most important
tools in investigation activities.
AREA has developed in house a solution
to pinpoint someone's position down to 10
meters using devices so small to fit in the palm
of one hand. MCR Tracer is made up of:
• The Tracking Device (TD) providing
localization data

1. MCR Player Interface (Area Monitoring Center)
The full integration of Tracer with MCR Voice
& Data Monitoring Center provides the best
performances and efficiency, allowing LEA
operators to use the same MCR Player
interface for all kinds of monitoring activities:
fixed and mobile telephony and IP data
interceptions, localization tracking services,
live audio and video. etc.

The TDs are installed on vehicles or others

2. MCR Tracer Anywhere (Web User-Interface)
By means of a specific Web-based
application, it is possible to render on maps
of the geographical data belonging to the
targets from any IF-enabled device (incl.
Smartphones I iPhone) and without a complete
monitoring center infrastructure.

moving Objects, allowing Law Enforcement
Agencies to acquire relevant data
concerning vehicles movements: history
and real-time monitoring, date and time of
all movements, average speed, real-time
localization on maps, etc.

3, Integration with specific Customer applications
AREA may provide the consulting support for
the full integration with existing systems.
Tracer is therefore highly scalable and
flexible.

• The Remote Control Management (RCM)
which receives, manages, stores and
displays geographical data and related
targets information.

TRACER ARCHITECTURE
The data captured by MCR Tracer are sent to a
MCR System for centralized storage, registration
and authentication.
The LEA operator can access these data using
the following interfaces, even in parallel:

LOCALISATION AND TRANSMISSION
TECHNOLOGIES
Tracer is based on a combined use of the
two main localization network protocols
(GPS and GSM) in order to grant the highest
performances and reliability:
• GPS system offers the fastest targets
localization, higher precision and
continuous update of date, time and other
basic tracking parameters
• GSM cell-based localization is less precise.
but can exploit much wider network coverage
and the network signal is not affected by
weather or environmental factors.
Two different transmission modes are supported:
• GPRS
• SMS
Localization data are transmitted by default
via GPRS. In case of missing GPRS signal,
data are sent via SMS.
To grant the best GSM coverage and system
availability, two SIM cards from different
operators can be installed on board.
If both networks are unavailable.
localization data are cached on the Tracer
device and forwarded when the connection
is re-established. Data are sent at
configurable intervals.

REMOTECONTROL
Complete remote control of the device is
possible via mobile phone, MCR Player or
MCR Tracer Anywhere using SMS or GPRS
connectivity.
Remote firmware upgrade and configuration,
with a wide range of customizable parameters.
Separated Admin & User access and rules.
HIGH RELIABILITY, AVAILABILITY
AND SECURITY
Each device is tested singularly under stress
conditions (mechanical, temperature).
• Double SIM
• Optimized management of autonomy thanks
to enhanced Hibernation and Auto-SwitchOn policies
• Power supplied by means of battery pack or
car battery

MCRTRACER +
Anywhere +

MCR Tracer Anywhere is a simple, complete
and intuitive solution for managing target
vehicles monitored through MCR Tracer.
The system supports both the analysis of
stored data and the live tracking of the moving
targets.
THE 'ANYWHERE' APPROACH
Thanks to a dedicated web server within the
MCR infrastructure, access to data collected
by MCR Tracer is granted from any device
connected to the Internet and equipped with
a standard browser: PC/Notebook from the
office, Smartphone/iPhone from the field or
from a remote location, etc.
A Virtual Private Network guarantees
maximum flexibility and data access without
compromises in terms of security.
MAPS
The integration between MCR Tracer Anywhere
and the world's leading vendors of digital maps
(Google, Microsoft) allows users to visualize
the position of their targets in many differ ways,
such as:
• Google Maps with "Maps" view
• Google Maps with "Satellite" view
• Google Maps 'Street view'

• Microsoft Virtual Earth
• Microsoft Virtual Earth with satellite views
• Microsoft Virtual Earth with aerial photography
TARGETS VISUALIZATION
The rendering of targets positions can be fully
customized through different parameters and
according to the most suitable investigation
approach. For example, the operator can
choose to visualize:
•
•
•
•

Single, defined GPS positions
Complete travels
Time periods and related movements
Journeys within selected points

LIVE CHASING AND USE OF MULTIPLE TARGETS
Chasing and pursuing targets is made easier
thanks to the ability to track several targets at
the same time.
Several available options allow operators
to assign defined targets to dedicated
visualization modes, according to investigators
needs and operations scenarios.
Two maps can be open on the same screen,
allowing the parallel view of separate targets.
When targets are in the same geographical
area, they will be shown on the same map,
using different colors.

The great variety
of possible
visualizations
guarantees the
highest precision
in pinpointing
and monitoring
the target
movements.

CONFIGURATION
Thanks to MCR Tracer Anywhere, the tracking
devices (Tracer) can be easily configured from
remote.
Advanced features such as GSM users, alarm
zones, real time chasing options, energy saving
settings etc., can be activated or modified in a
very easy and intuitive way.
DATA VISUALIZATION
MCR Tracer Anywhere data can be rendered in a
large spectrum of configurable resolutions (from
400x100 dpi up to 1400x1000 dpi), allowing
LEAs to adopt different media to visualize
targets, form the smallest, portable PocketPC to
the widest flat screen.
INTEGRATION
MCR Tracer is completely integrated in the MCR
Monitoring Center.
Now, thanks to Tracer Anywhere, it can be used
as a standalone solution for security activities.
