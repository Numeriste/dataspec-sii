GSM GPS Rapid Dep/oymentTracking System
The Mag3 is the third generation of H1SI's portable Rapid
Deployment system. Its unique performance, size and cutting
edge power management makes this system truly one of a
kind.

Rapid deployment
With the powerful earth-magnet plate attached to the Mag3 it
can rapidly be deployed within seconds. The unique 360 0
reception GPS antenna can "see" satellites without having to
have a direct view of the sky. This allows the Mag3 in
extreme circumstances to be deployed under vehicles
behind bumpers and still be operational.

Power consumption
This system is delivered with an internal rechargeable Li+
battery. Depending on the setting of the unique three Power
Mode Management configurations the Mag3 will be
operational between 30 hours and 31 days. Connected to
the standard external battery the Mag3 will be operational
between 90-120 hours and 84 days. Maximum operation
life is up to 200 hours and 155 days if multiple batteries
are con nected.

Data logging
The Mag3 has a powerful 8 Mb Flash memory onboard. This
allows the system to store information about position, time,
heading, speed, etc. The system can be configured to log
every 20 sec to every 42 mins. The Mag3 will send a SMS
warning when the log is nearly full to prevent overwriting of
information. The log file can be down loaded via GSM to the
CP2 tracking software or directly via an RS485 cable.

GSM
The Mag3 has a tri-band GSM module that allows the
system to be deployed in almost any GSM network around the
globe.

GeoFence
The Mag3 has 16 configurable GeoFence areas. The system
can be configured to trigger alarm messages and log data
when leaving and/or entering defined areas.
