As surveillance is often undertaken in bulk
up areas, Cobham's unique capability to
transmit and recelve informat~onrn difficult
electronic environments on land, sea and air
is in high demand.
Its products can transmit broadcast quality
video across non-line of sight digital w~reless
networks, and then distribute rece~vedvideo
across IP networks as required. This is cr~tical
for f~rstresponders such as the fire, police and
ambulance services. People who risk their l~ves
on a daily basis can trust Cobham's technology
to keep them in touch, relaying v~talv~deo

and audio communications when every
second counts.

Its products are used by law enforcement
and military clients worldwide, enabl~ngthem
to combat major crime, terrorism and drug
trafficking. Potential terrorist targets in New
York are being protected by breakthrough
digital video transmission technology since
9/11, using a new self-contained, portable,
overt surveillance system with powerful zoom
cameras featuring COFDM d~gitaltechnology.
The technology can also be used whilst
airborne, such as aircraft in South Africa fitted

with wireless video technology to provide
added security at the 2010 World Cup, and
Miami police using highly deployable wireless
video downlinks to their helicopters to achieve
their 20 miles coverage goal.

emperor penguins and lions to get close to

Cobham is a market leader in the development
and production of complete radio transmission
systems, and is at the forefront of technology
innovation in the fields of digital wireless.

Its Irfe-criticalwireless communication
systems and technical surveillance solutions
are a powerful weapon in the war on terror
for law enforcement, mrlitary and intellrgence
communities. They provide superior agent
protection, with unrque capabilities which
ensure multi-agency interoperabrlity, as well as
secure digital encrypted transmissions.
In the world of radio broadcasting,its fixed
audio telemetry links can be placed at popular
sites, such as airport terminals, sports stadia
or music venues -wherever high quality radio
lrnks are regularly required. These can then be
used to provide a permanent link between the
site and the studio, meaning reporters only
have to carry a wireless rad~om~keto conduct

interviews which can be broadcast over a
guaranteed, quality radio connection.
Focusing on minraturisat~on,signal quality and

COFDM I P Mesh radios are the latest
innovations in the expandingrange of mobile

Up to eight of the radios can be combined
into a ground-breaking IP mesh network the first fluid, self-forming,self-healing
mesh. Offering genuine non-line of sight
coverage, the I P Mesh system is truly
mobile and therefore supplies a network
not limited by range - one which will deliver
in environments too tough for other radio
solutions to cope with.
Unlike other wireless options, the COFDM
IP Mesh constantly readjusts itself as nodes
move. forming any shape of network, including
chains, stars and random networks.

Integrated Surveillance Solutions - CBRN
1 Hltchrng the Scene Barrier Management System t o a polrce
lcle makes it a hrghly-mobrle solutron

Governments and police forces around the
world are more aware than ever of the CBRN
(chemical, biological, radiologicaland nuclear)
threat to the communities they protect.
I f a CBRN event occurs, it is vital that people are
removed from the vicinity quickly and that local
warnings are broadcast as widely as possible.
Cobham, working in partnershipwith industryleadingspec~alistsand the United Kingdom's
Police Natlonal (PN) CBRN Centre, has therefore
produced simple, rugged mobile solutions to
greatly increase efficiency. Successful crowd
communication and control can now be
handled by less than flve officers at each slte,
improving police and public safety and enabling
better allocation of resources by incident
controllers.
The Cobham CBRN Solutions can also be
used to protect key assets and control crowd
movement during public order events. Quick
and simple to deploy, they significantly reduce
the manpower required to set up cordons and
free officers for more hands-on policing.
