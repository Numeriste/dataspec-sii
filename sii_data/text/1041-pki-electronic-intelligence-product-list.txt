PKI 7400

Terahertz Imaging System
The PKI 7400 Terahertz Imaging System is based
on passive terahertz imaging technology, without
illuminating or irradiating subjects in any way. No
XRays are used. Suspective objects are imaged
by passively detecting terahertz waves naturally
emitted by all objects and people. Terahertz
waves pass through opaque materials such as
clothing, packaging and certain building
materials and can form images of objects, such

PKI 7405

Through-the-Wall Detector
This device is a small handheld system for the
detection and localisation of human beings or
animals being suspected in inaccessible rooms.
The typical application is during anti-terrorist
interventions and disasters like earthquakes,
demolitions, etc. Its high sensitivity even assures
reliable detection of objects hidden behind solid
structures like walls, wreckage, etc. According to
the micro-movements performed by their life
functions the system detects and localises them.
In common use, the PKI 7405 can be deployed
vertically for forward observing or horizontally
for up- and down scanning. The easiest way of
operation is just to place the device on the wall or
any other solid object. Another possibility is to
mount the system on a tripod and to observe the
obstacle from a distance of up to 10 m. An
optional LAN remote control allows the operator
to survey the scene from a safe distance, which
is especially useful during long term operation.
PKI 7405 has two basic modes, one for fast
moving and one for non- or slow moving objects.
The fast moving mode has a better tracking
accuracy whilst the slow moving mode is more
suitable to detect objects which are not moving.
Specifications:
• Scalable range: up to 20 m
• Weight: approx 5 kg
• Breath detection

PKI 7650

Bionic Sensor
The PKI 7650 is a portable and selfcontained
mini laboratory being developed in co-operation
with renowned German institutes for
silicon-technology and eBiochip systems. On the
spot it provides a fully automatic recognition of
selected biological agents within less than 30
minutes. The flexible technology of the PKI 7650
is based on silicon-chips, on which antibody
substances respectively DNA-structures are
placed. This allows the identification of all kinds
of important biological agents in next
procedures. As all these biological agents are
hard to identify, and their influence to human
bodies only takes place after a certain period, it is
most essential to have a fast and reliable
identification of such substances for an effective
and reliable prevention. Just with this single and
innovative concept of sensors, the whole range
of dangerous biological agents can be
determined. By means of different chipsticks,
even in accordance with customer’s
requirements, the range of detectable materials
can be enlarged . For such amendments,
alterations at the base-unit are not necessary. For

122

each integration of further enlargements, like
automatic feeding of up to ten chipsticks and/or
upcoming PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction),
various adaptable modules are available. The PKI
7650 is in use with many NBC and fire-fighting
departments worldwide and with its dual
measuring positions for negative and positive
results, it offers a fast and reliable method to
determine selected biological agents. Using the
PKI 7650 in urban traffic systems, like

underground-, bus- and railroad stations it will
give an immediate indication about pollution with
dangerous biological agents. This enables the
special forces to act before the first unspecified
symptoms at human beings are recognised
(most often only after 24 to 48 hours).
Furthermore the PKI 7650 can also be attached
to our PKI 7550 Modular EOD/IEDD Robot for
extended security to the first responding team in
cases of emergency.

PKI 8040

Silent Drill
In most observation operations it is
indispensable to have the possibility of direct
viewing into the room in question. This can
easily be done with our various endoscopes.
However, first of all a small hole has to be drilled
through the wall. As this has to be effected
without noise, PKI ELECTRONIC INTELLIGENCE
is pleased to introduce the PKI 8040 as the one
and only device for technical surveillance,
special forces and law enforcement units. This
drilling device is a special construction which is
not available in common stores. It provides an
automatic propulsion at low rotation speed, thus
reducing drilling noises to a minimized level.
Holes in walls of up to 60 cm thickness can be
drilled with diameters of 1 mm upwards. It may
be hand held or attached to the wall by a
mounting bracket. After being attached to the
wall, it does not have to be removed in order to
exchange the drill bits, as all drill bits can be
exchanged from the rear of the drill. A lever on

top of the drill assists the operator with keeping
in level and a monopod, attached to the drill,
maintains stability.
Specifications:
• Chuck standard 133 mm for drills from 1mm
diam. upwards
• Power supply 85 - 270 VAC (50-60Hz) from
mains or 12 VDC (20Amps) rechargeable

PKI 9100

Disguised Metal Detector
Either for participants at specific meetings or
during general check-up tasks at entrances,
where people have to be examined, without their
knowledge, the PKI 9100 Disguised Metal
Detector is an especially designed equipment for
detection of both metallic and non-metallic
objects. Because of its hand-free application the
operator - at one and the same time - can
examine a person physically and investigate,
automatically and electronically, for the presence
of metallic objects. Its silent vibrating alarm
allows fully covert operation and is able to
discriminate between large and small metal
objects. The PKI 9100 comes in one universal
size, which fits both the left and right forearm,
fixed by a velcrostrip, and can be hidden under
every normal clothing like shirt or jacket. It is

simple to use as the user just approaches his
arm inconspicuously towards the suspect
person. If this person carries a weapon or any
other metallic object, the vibrator will give its
silent alarm.
Specifications:
• Weight approx. 200 g
• Operating time approx. 80 hours with standard
9 V battery
• Ideal for body searches
• Combines physical and electronic
investigations
• Silent vibrating alarm

PKI 9105

Hydraulic Jamb Spreader
In several cases, doors have to be opened by
force in a silent and quick manner because
criminal acts like drug dealing, hostages or
terrorism have to be intercepted and rooms have
to be entered to arrest the expected perpetrators.
The PKI 9105 is designed for Police and Military
Special Assault Teams and other government
departments especially trained for such tasks.
This device is using a quiet hydraulic pressure
technique to spread door jambs and release latch
bolts. The non-slip clutch allows the telescopic
bar to hand-fit into the door opening. The
operator then uses the hand pump, which
quickly extends the piston and exerts 3 tons of
force - enough power to open or break most
types of single doors. The system virtually works
noiseless, is fast and instantly adjustable.

PKI 9110

Series of Door Rams
In combination with our PKI 9105 Hydraulic
Jamb Spreader, the PKI 9110 as a series of door
rams with different sizes and weights offers a
perfect combination with our full range of tools
to open doors by force. Every police-, military-,
anti-drug and special operational task force team
should be equipped with this product as it is the
one and only device that is capable to give
immediate entrance into rooms where scenes of
crime are suspected. It really could not be easier
to use and no setting up time is required.
Originally the PKI 9110 have been developed for
US Police Swat teams, but now are more and
more used by police and Military Special Forces
worldwide. Simply get in position in front of the
door, swing the ram back to gain momentum and
swing it forward to smash the toughest door.
Three different versions are available each one being electrically non-conductive,
shock-absorbent, compact and this at a very
reasonable price.

Specifications:
Different versions are available but each
department should have the full range of rams in
order to be prepared for every different
application. Therefore we offer the complete
range as a set consisting of:
PKI 9110/A - This ram is designed for one-man
operation with a length of 76 cm and a weight of
16 kg. It only requires 50 to 60 cm of backswing,
making it ideal for use in close quarters.
PKI 9110/B - This ram is a heavier version, 25 cm
longer and 7 kg heavier than the above ram and

can be used by either one or two persons
simultaneously.
PKI 9110/C - This ram is the smallest and most
cost-effective door-ram yet designed. It is ideal
for very confined spaces. It is made of specially
modified steel shot and is only 41 cm in length,
but has the same weight (16 kg) as the
PKI 9110/A, and provides the same kinetic
energy.
We recommend the complete set of
PKI 9110/A-C, however, each ram of course can
be ordered separately as well.

PKI 9115

Underwater Metal Detector
The PKI 9115 is a versatile under water detection
system being consequently the further
development of our former land & underwater
metal
detectors.
Improved
detection
performance and a wide auto-adaptation to
interfering metal components characterise the
new PKI 9115. The full unit, and especially the
electronic design, is based on our thousandfold
proven technology being in service with many
government departments worldwide. PKI 9115 is
tested for water pressure up to 10 bars and is
very comfortable to handle for the diver. It is
operated by only one adjuster. PKI 9115 can
detect minimum amount of mine shallows being
buried - such as A/P 72 A - at operational depth.
Larger undefined objects can be located up to a
depth of 1.5 m. For even larger depths, a further
sensor is available.
PKI 9115 applies a dynamic mode pulse
induction concept. Short bipolar magnetic pulses
generate detection signals from ferrous or
non-ferrous metals and alloys. Target acquisition
is indicated as visual or audible alarm. A silent
mode (visual LED only) improves operator’s
safety on “smart” munitions with acoustic
sensors. When used with a larger search head of
80 x 80 cm (optionally available), the detection
range is significantly extended and larger objects
- such as 105 mm shells, bombs, torpedoes etc.
- may be detected at 2 m depth or more. The
detector operates on a dynamic search mode,
which compensates interference from metal
diving equipment. If required, the detector can be
operated in a “silent mode” without headset.
In such case the red LED will indicate target

acquisition. To operate the PKI 9115 switch the
rotary sensitivity calibrator into position I (low),
II or III (high). Sensitivity can be changed
stepless within ranges I-III by an internal adjuster
inside the electronics cylinder.
Optional accessories - available on request:

PKI 9120

Mine Detector
The PKI 9120 mine detector is designed for use
on all grounds even on compact soils such as
volcanic soil or laterit, which makes it suitable for
use everywhere in the world. In many regions
mine detectors can be influenced by a mixture of
soils such as laterit, magnetic rock and by soil
conductivity due to monsoon rain. The wide band
compensation of this PKI mine detector meets
such environmental working conditions and also
rejects interference from saltwater due to its
pulse induction operating principle. Components
subject to wear and tear can easily be exchanged
without further calibration work. This eases fault
definition and significantly improves equipment
availability in the field.
Rugged design and constructional features,
coupled with various accessories make the PKI
mine detector a very versatile equipment, which
allows use in lying, kneeling or upright position.

System consists in its selectivity regarding small
metal objects buried close to the surface and - in
comparison to active metal detectors - its
excellent detection range on large objects
(transmitter effect). For conventional operations,
there is a galvanometer and an audio alarm
integrated into the electronic box. Furthermore
the system has an analogue data output and can
therefore also be linked to an external data logger
to allow data recording.

Contraband Detector
This item can positively detect drugs, explosives,
weapons, currency and much more. Its typical
application field is the inspection of tires, car
doors, fuel tanks, wall and lined containers,
aircraft, trucks, caravans, bus, trains etc.
Identical packages, flower shipments, boats and
ships, freight container.
Principle of Operation:
PKI Contraband Detector measures the mass
density of the inspected objects and indicates the
difference in density between illegally hidden
goods (drugs, explosives, weapons, currency,
etc.) and the object in which the contraband is
hidden. For example, an “empty” tire filled with
air and a tire filled with drugs give different
results or an “empty” cross member in a freight
container stuffed with contraband indicates a

different density then a full one. It also detects
radioactive materials. The PKI Contraband
Detector directs a beam of energy into the
inspected object. A filled space reflects back
more energy than an empty space. As PKI

Contraband Detector is moved across the
surface of the object, the measurement is
displayed on a digital LCD and an alarm is given
if the density changes or radioactive material is
encountered.

Image Processing System
The PKI 9410 is a full colour video processor for
the simultaneous display of live and stored
images (still pictures). It is designed for police
stations, border controls, immigration and
customs offices and any other place where
banknotes and documents have to be checked
against falsifications. For all these types of
document examinations, the PKI 9410 offers a
tremendous wide range of different functions
such as overlay, addition, subtraction and side by
side view for easy comparison of genuine and
suspect documents. The main features of the PKI
9410 are:
• Comparison by superimposition
• Box image inside large image
(PIP=Picture in Picture)
• Horizontal split screen
• Vertical split screen
• Forgery detection by superimposition
The PKI 9410 selects one of two analogue video
inputs and converts it to a digital format. Every
further processing thereafter is carried out in the
digital realm but still preserving a highest video

quality. The digital image can be frozen in the full
resolution frame store and the output combined
in various ways with the live image. After that the
combined image finally is converted back to an
analogue format for display on monitor. From the
front panel the operator can adjust the quality of
the incoming video and the way in which the two
images have to be combined. Cursors are used to
adjust the selected parameter or to move the

picture. The reset/home button returns the
parameter to the standard setting.

examination of all types of suspect documents. It
is particularly useful for officials and immigration
officers at sea- and airports, mobile border
controls and the scene of crime officers. A large
unobstructed working area allows quick and easy
examination using the four integral light sources:
• A diffuse white light for visual examination in
low light conditions
• Two black light lamps providing a strong
ultraviolet source for examination of bleaching,
alterations and fluorescent security marks
• A transmissive source for inspection of
watermarks and internal threads
• An intense fibre optic illuminator for
examination of intended writing and for
transmission through photographs.
PKI 9415 can be operated by three different
power sources: an internal battery, a wide range
of AC power supplies and an external DC power
source - like car batteries.
PKI 9415 is housed in a rugged ABS hardcover
case with “O-Ring” sealing for the protection
against water, dust and other contaminants.

PKI 9525

Door Opening Kit for Cars and Rooms
Professional observation often requires the
installation of surveillance devices in locked
rooms or cars. In order to solve this problem we
have developed an universal kit for opening
doors of rooms and cars. The PKI 9525 should
be the basic equiment of every government
organisation being involved in the fight against
terrorism and criminal acts. It contains the
standard pick sets, hooks for opening the doors
of cars and a gun plug for grinding barrel locks.
If required we can of course also offer the
complete range of our door opening devices plus
our training seminars at our premises. We wish
to point out that the user of our door opening kit
must have some experience and talent in order to
be successful in this field.

PKI 9530

Car ID Set
Very often the original chassis numbers of stolen
cars, machines etc. are made invisible, grinded
away or even replaced by new, forged numbers.
With our PKI 9530 the originally stamped
numbers can be made visible again. This
identification set especially has been assembled
for the use by special police forces and other
government departments being related to the
identification of stolen cars or other valuable
items. Basically, a testing can only be executed
on iron materials and if the ID-numbers have
been impacted automatically or by hand. A
magnetic flux is produced in the soft-iron-core
by two magnetic coils. This magnetic flux is
directed into the material via the poles. If the
lines of magnetic flux impact vertically hit on a
material-compression, some of the lines drop
out of the material and from the magnetic stray
field at the compression field point. Now the

magnetic powder has to be applied on the
compression point and the magnetic stray field
will attract all available iron parts of the powder
in order to react against the magnetic
air-resistance.
Specifications:
• Content:
1 pce hand yoke magnet for evidence of grinded
ID-numbers
1 pce UV lamp for visualisation of numbers
1 pce NFR 101 Aerosol tin, high fluorescent
magnetic powder
1 pce cleaner for degreasing of surfaces

PKI 9585

Door Opening Kit for Cars
In many cases of surveillance it is of utmost
importance to open a monitored car without any
risk of damage in order to install for example
microphones, cameras or GPS-systems. For this
application there are different systems available
which we have combined in one set:
1.) Decoder for car lock cylinders
2.) Lock picks for car lock cylinders
3.) Car lock scanner
4.) Car Killing Kit
These special tools can also be delivered
separately. In most cases it is important to find
out the model and year of manufacture of the car,
for example by using our decoder for car lock
cylinders. With this code you are now able to
directly compose a special key for the car by
using the provided master keys. For this, you do
not need any further tools or machines.
Everything is contained in the set. Our software
can decode even the latest generations of car
lock cylinders and then offer a proposal for the
key code. Concerning the lock picks it is also

essential to know the model and year of
manufacture of the car. Please indicate this
together with your order. The tools of the car lock
scanner are used to crack the code of the plates
integrated in the tumbler of the car lock cylinders
even of the latest generation. By means of the

cracked code it is now possible to cut a matching
key. The car killing kit consists of different bent
needles made out of steel wire which are inserted
through the rubber joint in order to reach the
locking mechanism of the car.

PKI 9590

Electric Powered Multipick Door Opening Kit
This door opening kit works with up to 44.000
vibrations per minute. Even locks with more than
20 tumblers on several locking sections can be
opened within seconds. The frequency of the
strokes can be adjusted continuously. The power
supply is guaranteed by means of a built-in
battery. Most of the opening kits of our
competitors destroy the door lock which is of
course acceptable in case of an emergency.
However, such tools cannot be used for
surveillance operations. PKI 9590 can be used in
order to open and relock all current available key
cylinders without damaging them at all. This is
imperative for all kind of room surveillance. The
PKI 9590 works in such a way that a special pick
is inserted into the locking canal of the key
cylinder. The pick is then put into extremely high
vibrations which are transferred at the correct

angle to the locking bolts of the key cylinder. The
locking bolts put into such a vibration fall into
their corresponding locking positions and such
enabling the core of the key cylinder to rotate
freely as if it was opened by using a matching
key.

our thermal lance. It penetrates any material like
cast iron, steel, stainless steel, concrete, granite,
nickel, ceramic or titanium compound as well as
aluminium. The fuel rods reach a temperature of
up to 5.500°C at the tip and therefore can cut,
melt or liquefy the different materials indicated
above. Each lance burns about 30-40 seconds.

versatile and reliable. The PKI 9595 contains
everything in order to carry all tools with you.
The application is very simple and safe, because

no dangerous acetylene or high power are
required.

Police, Customs and Military Equipment
PKI 9600

Forged Chassis Numbers Identification Set
Unfortunately the number of stolen cars is
steadily increasing. The police has to face a
serious problem. Even when they trace stolen
cars, the original stamped chassis number often
has been made invisible, grinded off or has been
replaced by a new, forged number. Now PKI
created the easy-to-use PKI 9600 set which is
indispensable in order to prove the car theft, as it
makes the originally stamped chassis number
visible again. You simply have to apply the
adequate etching gel on the place where you
suspect the chassis number, to treat it with the
included brush and afterward with the
neutralising liquid. In order to protect your hands
always put on the included gloves. After this
treatment the chassis number will clearly
reappear.

There is a magnetic (PKI 9530) and a chemical
(PKI 9600) procedure as the surface of the
material with chassis numbers may vary from
one car type to the other. So it could be very
useful to test both methods.
Specifications:
• Dimensions of the aluminium case:
32 x 25 x 10 cm
• Weight: 1 kg
• Contents: 3 bottles with etching gel for
aluminium, steel and copper
2 bottles with neutralising liquid
1 brush, 1 magnifier with UV-light

way we can supply the right solutions. With our
PKI 9605 Key Copying Kit we offer the best way
for all special forces to enter the room as often as
required under the condition that the original key
is available at least once. For each and every type
of key you can easily obtain a totally identical
copy of the original, without the need of any key
blank and within only a few minutes. The original
has to be fixed in the supplied mould and the
mixed-up impression material has to be filled
into this. After curing of the material, the original
key has to be removed and the remaining shape

PKI 9700

Electric Shock Baton
The PKI 9700 Electric Shock Baton is the most
versatile instrument to protect police officers,
anti-terrorist squads and security guards from
personal attacks at demonstrations, riots and
other dangerous situations. Even private security
companies should be equipped with this device
for their own personal protection during their
daily tasks. The unit is small enough to be placed
into a beltsling like provided with our PKI 9255
Immediate Response Jacket or can be fixed to
the hand by the attached sling and then being
right at hand at any time. The PKI 9700, coated
by hard rubber material, provides an electric
shock to the aggressor whenever touched but
also can be used as a common baton.
Additionally the PKI 9700 produces a cracking
noise and high voltage sparks whenever the
electric shock function is activated by the
integrated switch. This already will stop any
further attack but even if the aggressive person
steps forward, a single touch, of some seconds
only, to its hip or upper-body region will
immobilise him for a certain time, without
causing any dangerous, long-lasting or even
lethal injuries.

Specifications:
• Max. output voltage approx. 30.000 V

Safety Suitcase
The PKI 9710 has been developed for secure
transportation of various valuable items, such as
cash money, jewels, important documents, etc. It
features multiple functions to avoid theft and
pilferage. Sensors are integrated in the handle
and both surfaces of the suitcase, which can be
activated, so that the PKI 9710 emits
high-voltage pulsed electric shocks of 30 KV. The
wireless activation is done by means of a small
remote control that must be carried separately
from the suitcase. This remote control also
activates the “loss function”, which prevents
from simply forgetting it somewhere during
voyages or theft. If the distance between the
remote control and the PKI 9710 exceeds 3-15
m, a loud warning signal will be emitted. If ever
the suitcase has really been stolen by someone,
for your own protection you should wait until the
person has obtained a distance of at least 50 m,
in order to activate the anti-robbery function of

PKI 9745

Irritant Gas Defence System
The PKI 9745 has been developed as ancillary
component for already installed alarm systems.
It consists in a defence system with irritant gas,
which is approved as protection against people,
combined with a warning announcement. Its
housing is made in extra solid stainless steel to
protect against damage. Once the main alarm
system is turned on, the PKI 9745 switches into
standby mode. Only an alert will activate the
defence system. At first a loud warning message
will be announced: “Leave the secure area
immediately, or irritant gas will be released”. This
clear and unmistakable warning gives the
intruder the possibility to retreat. Otherwise, if he
ignores it and continues to enter the detection
range of the PKI 9745, the irritant gas will
automatically be ejected. If this discouraged the
intruder and he backs out, the PKI 9745 will turn
back into standby mode. If the intruder however

continues to approach, further irritant gas
ejections will be released. After each ejection the
dose of irritant gas will be increased. By turning
off the alarm system, the PKI 9745 will be turned
off as well.
Specifications:
• Irritant gas, approved as protection against
people in 400 ml cartridges covering areas up
to 300 m². Stainless steel housing with
adjustable wall bracket, control unit protected
against damage, with LED-display and key
switch to protect against unintended activation,

• Weight: approx. 6.5 kg

PKI 9750

Defence Tool
These tools are indispensable for all persons

punch-knife-slash and bullet attacks but of
various elements which have to be considered
carefully. Besides high protection the vest has to
provide a maximum of comfort to the wearer so
that it is steadily worn.
Specifications:
• Available colours: black, blue, green
• Protection: against punch and knife-slash
• Knife-slash restraint: 35 Nm
• Note: Use of this vest makes sense when
application of guns is highly unlikely.
This means areas with personnel access control
such as prisons, at court, or major events
where special security attention is paid.

PKI 9780

UV-Set
This UV-set consists in a strong UV-LED light,
UV-ink, UV-pen and UV-spray and offers all
facilities to convict perpetrators. Once applied on
different surfaces and items, the UV-substances
remain invisible for the human eye and can only
be visualized by means of the strong UV-LED
light. This is also the case for texts written with
our UV-ink. To do so, just fill the UV-ink into a
common fountain pen. If a person touches the
UV-marked items, these UV-substances will stick
on his hands, fingers or clothes. Afterwards he
can easily be identified with the UV-LED light. Of
special interest is our UV-spray. Applied onto
bank notes, floor grounds, jewelleries etc. it
adheres to them during several days and
transmits itself to the person that touches them.

Afterwards nothing is easier than to provide
evidence with our strong UV-LED light.

PKI 9800

Perpetrator Convincing Kit
Visible perpetrator materials are special powders
or pastes that are applied on valuable items like
bank-notes, documents, laptops etc. Touching
these marked items will create a long-lasting,
clearly visible and permanently existing dot on
the fingers and hands. Even persistent washing
with water and soap cannot remove these stains
which easily detect the theft. Invisible perpetrator
materials, however, are special powders or
pastes which are only visible under special
UV-lamps (like our PKI 5405) and are invisible to
the naked human eye. With the PKI 9800, we
offer a complete set of every necessary material
for a rapid and effective perception of
perpetrators. Other companies only offer single
components which then have to be assembled to
a workable kit. Our complete case PKI 9800

offers all this in a “all-in-one” assembly of
state-of-the-art materials, guarantying that each
government department is perfectly equipped
with an outstanding assortment of visible and

PKI 9885

Surface Penetrating Radar
The PKI 9885 is a revolutionary, highperformance system designed for detecting any
object concealed under the ground or behind
walls. It has been designed according to the
specific requests of several government
authorities worldwide and is now in full operation
with Police, Military, VIP-protection and
commercial companies. The unit is completely
weatherproof and can operate in any type of soil
condition. Depth of detection depends on size of
object and type of soil, but is typically up to 3
meters.
The complete system consists of 3 main parts:
• the controller ( which in fact is a ruggedised
personal computer)
• the antenna set
• the transmitter/receiver head, which transmits
the information from the antenna to the
controller
The PKI 9885 works by sending out pulses of
electromagnetic energy and detecting the
electrical echo caused by dielectric differences
within the surface being investigated. One of the
main features is that during a search, as the
antenna is moved across a surface, the data is
shown in colour and in real time on the monitor.

This means that an anomaly beneath the surface
can be seen immediately whenever the PKI 9885
passes over it, thus making instant and on-site
decisions possible. The data can be downloaded
and printed on a paper-strip or stored on the hard
disc for further processing or inclusion in a
survey report. The standard system is supplied
with a 500 MHz antenna which has a typical
penetration depth of 1.5 to 2.5 meters in good
conditions, i.e. where sand and peat are good
and salt water and clay are poor. The other

antennas in the range are the 250 MHz (typical
penetration depth of 2.5 to 4.5 meters) and the 1
GHz and 2 GHz antennas. As a geneeral guide,
the lower frequency antennas (250 and 500
MHZ) are normally used for work below ground
and the higher frequency for work above the
ground. Important to know is that as soon as the
penetration depth increases, the resolution will
decrease. Hence the 1 GHz and 2 GHz antennas
are very useful for locating very small objects
behind a surface - such as a wall.

PKI 9890

Explosive Isolation Unit
The Explosive Isolation unit is a simple-to-use
and intrinsically safe steel box developed for safe
confinement of postal bombs, explosives and
IED devices. It is lined with an unique blast
attenuation material that resembles a “sponge”
to absorb blast and fragments. These are
contained within the unit, thus allowing for the
fast and effective collection of forensic evidence
if required.
