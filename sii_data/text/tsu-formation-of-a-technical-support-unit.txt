Product Information

Formation
of a Technical Support Unit
Introduction

The following report is intended to give an outline to the formation of a Technical
Support Unit (TSU). This document is not intended to be the definitive answer, it
should be considered as a discussion paper, to be amended as the role of the TSU
changes and technology and equipment develops.
The TSU is not a department that can be set up, "off the shelf", simply by copying
an existing department. It must be expertly planned to meet the needs of each
individual country and the role it is expected to play within that country's
intelligence gathering sphere.
To do this, it is necessary to assess the objectives of the TSU thoroughly and then
establish the most effective methods of attaining those objectives.
All existing intelligence gathering sources should be looked at carefully to assess
how their input can be used by the TSU to avoid duplication of effort.
The prime objective of the TSU is: To provide technical support to The Special
Operations Groups and all the Intelligence and Security Services within the client
country.
The TSU must be a formidable organisation with the multi-functional ability to react
to any situation, anytime and anywhere. They must be capable of supporting a
short term operation, such as assisting an anti-narcotics undercover team, with all
types of equipment ranging from binoculars to the full surveillance of the target
using cameras, transmitters, recording devices, etc.
They must also have the ability and capability to respond to a high priority incident,
such as hi-jacking, hostage and/or siege situation or kidnapping, in a professional
manner; taking command of the forward area and establishing liaison with all the
units that are called to deal with the event by effective and efficient planning, coordination and organisation of the technical surveillance.
All information from these situations must be relayed to the Senior Officer's
Forward Command Post for tactical evaluation and/or presented to the Senior
Officer for evaluation and to provide assistance with the further planning of the
operation. The intelligence must also be collated and systematically exploited in a
professional manner for subsequent presentation as evidence.
Ideally, the personnel involved should be proficient in many technical skills such as
photography, information analysis, computers, and audio/video transmission and
recording and surveillance techniques.
Previous experience of conducting
investigations, covert activities, information/intelligence gathering and analysis are
distinct advantages.
It is also important to have within the department, experts in the individual
disciplines to provide support to the TSU officers in the field.
The selection of equipment is vital and constant liaison with the
manufacturer/supplier is necessary to ensure the TSU is equipped with the most
appropriate equipment and trained for the assignment/role.
As this equipment is not available from a single manufacturer, a company must be
selected which has the experience within the intelligence-gathering field to act as
a focal point and lead the co-ordination of equipment procurement and essential
training of the TSU. Equipment selection falls into the following main categories:
1.
2.
3.

Training plays an important part in the daily life of the TSU. The more training and
'hands on' experience the officers receive the more proficient the unit will
become. Therefore, selection of an organisation that can provide the best training
should be sought. Instructors with previous experience in this type of special
operation should be used to allow their expertise to be passed on.
Initial implementation of the TSU will take approximately two years to complete.
This includes the procurement, training, service and maintenance support and an
in-country technical assistance programme, which should include equipment
upgrade and evaluation procedures.
TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT
The availability of technical facilities during a major incident introduces volumes of
information, which are far in excess of those experienced in normal circumstances.
The management of this information will be at three levels - tactical, operational
and political. It is essential that all those who may be involved in an incident are
trained, proficient and practised to deal with the new environment.
TACTICAL
The most obvious tactical requirement is for armed intervention but identification
and recognition of all involved is needed. There must be a facility for investigators
to have access to the information and a requirement for the control of all services
in hostile hands, detailed building plans, medical knowledge, dietary rules,
negotiation skills and evacuation procedures.
OPERATIONAL
The operational control is concerned with the logistics of the scene and the
translation of political decisions into action. It is the centre that gives authority to
the tactical commanders on the course of action to be taken. Which of the
services is in control must be decided at this level and the command
responsibilities must be clear and unambiguous to everyone involved.
POLITICAL
A separate centre for political control is essential. Although all the operational and
intelligence agencies will be represented, it is a matter for the nation's leaders to
decide the domestic and international strategies to be adopted.
MAJOR INCIDENT
This operational scenario covers hi-jacking, hostage taking, national emergencies
and other high profile operations where a rapid response is required by the TSU to
provide technical support and specialist equipment.
Using an aircraft hi-jack as our basis for discussion the TSU would deploy in the
following manner.
*

Initial reconnaissance of the forward area with Senior Duty Officer making
the necessary recommendations for technical equipment deployment.

*

Deploy the Technical Surveillance Vehicle (TSV).

*

Deploy Forward Observation Units (FOUs) equipped with thermal imaging
and low light CCTV cameras which can either be linked via cable or be
stand alone using video transmission and telemetry to relay the information

CONFIDENTIAL

page 3

back to the TSV. These units can either use battery or be connected to the
mains supply or emergency generator.
*

Install the FOU repeater link if required.

*

Distribute binoculars and night vision scopes to the forward manned
observation posts and establish the communications links.

*

Establish the sniper control links with the snipers and their control and relay
these communications to the Senior Officers Forward Command Post.

*

Establish the communications link between the Senior Duty Officer and all
other locations.

*

Commence recording of all transmissions from video and audio sources,
Forward Observation posts, snipers and their control and other radio
communications relating to this operation.

*

Establish emergency power generator or connect to local mains power for
TSV and FOU.

*

Ascertain if a hostage telephone link is to be established and arrange its
deployment with the negotiating team.

*

Determine with the assault team leader what additional equipment and
information they require, e.g. low noise drilling, endoscopes, video pictures
and audio from the scene, etc.

*

After all the primary tasks have been completed formalise the link with the
Senior Officers Forward Command Post. Deploy repeaters for the
communications link if required.

*

Whilst the TSV is being brought "on line" the Seniors Officers Command
Post should be deployed and the Portable Technical Surveillance System
(PTSS) installed ready to accept the communications link from the TSV.

*

PTSS officers establish the communications link as a priority.

*

Duplicate recording of all activity on the communications link from the TSV.

*

Establish full communications network for the Senior Officers - landline,
Inmarsat, GSM cellular, fax, radio transceivers, etc.

*

Arrange for the additional technical surveillance equipment to be brought to
the PTSS team location in case it is required later.

*

Establish if an Emergency Holding Area is to be set up; if required,
establish the necessary communications link with the Emergency Area
System (EAS).

Major Incident (cont'd)
When these priorities have been completed the TSU Team Leader should liaise
with the Senior Officers and offer advice on deployment of other equipment as the
operation unfolds.

TECHNICAL SUPPORT UNIT – BASIC FACILITIES
Before a Technical Support Unit (TSU) is fully functional it is imperative to look at
all the necessary Support and Headquarters facilities that must be in place prior to
ensure the TSU has a secure base on which to build in the future.
This report will look at all the aspects of the Support Infrastructure as the author is
not qualified to comment on the Command structure that exists or the client
wishes to put in place.
The following topics are not exhaustive they are meant to be the basis of
discussion prior to making final plans for the building blocks of the Technical
Support Unit.

SUPPORT INFRASTRUCTURE
Apart from the obvious things to consider such as office accommodation,
equipment etc. the Director of a TSU must also ensure the security of the building
and its contents, therefore a state of the art security system for the building must
be installed,
This would include CCTV, Personnel screening upon entry and exit, access control
for all doors (staff and visitors) dedicated ID cards for staff linked to pin number
locks for the more secure areas.
Special arrangements for visitors must be put in place to ensure they are kept to
designated areas and not allowed free access to the secure areas of the building.
For the purposes of this exercise the building security system is to the level
required.

COMMUNICATIONS
There must be a complete secure communications network dedicated to the TSU
personnel and operations; it should be flexible enough to allow the command team
and the communications centre to link with other departments and joint
operations.
The communications network should form into a tier system such as;
 TSU Headquarters communications room
 TSU Operations room
 TSU Surveillance Vehicles (command and operators)
 TSU Foot surveillance officers
 TSU Fixed Observation portable radios

CONFIDENTIAL

page 5

Using the tier system all the TSU operational and command officers can be in
contact either with Headquarters or within the surveillance cell or team.
Therefore the communications equipment will fall into the following categories;
 Hi power Base station transmitter and receiver.
 Repeater system from headquarters to ensure coverage of city areas.
 Vehicle transceivers covertly fitted into passenger cars and surveillance
vans, linked with GPS
 Bodyworn transceivers and covert harnesses
 Portable transceivers for use in fixed observation points, linked with GPS
All the radio traffic should be recorded for later use if required and security
purposes.
COMMUNICATIONS SCANNING
The communications room should have the capability to scan the RF spectrum for
illegal radio traffic and link with vehicle or fixed directional finding equipment to
track the source.
This direction finding infrastructure can also be used with a tracking system for
vehicles, bodyworn or baggage.
MAPPING
Maps of the country should be available or scanned into a computer for use by the
operational teams in conjunction with the communications and operational room.
For example a surveillance team can request directions to a designated area, the
communications team can display the map onto a large screen and relay
instructions.
For example, an operation is running the location of the team’s vehicles can be
displayed for the commander to direct the operation and deploy his resources to
the best advantage.
For example a Hi Jack or hostage situation develops, a tracking device can be
placed on the target vehicle and displayed in the operations room and locally with
the surveillance team leader.
The digital scanned map can be installed in laptop computers for the surveillance
team’s information.
OTHER METHODS OF COMMUNICATION
Within the communications room all the latest methods of communications should
be installed i.e. ADSL, ISDN, PSTN telephone line, satellite communications, GSM
cellular telephones, HF transceivers, Iridium telephones.
A suitable communications switch should be used to link all the methods of
communications together and allow all forms of equipment to communicate and
link into the Operations Room system.
Digital transmission equipment to transmit and receive information transmitted
from surveillance teams or fixed sites can be utilised to its fullest capability.

CONFIDENTIAL

page 6

This will allow secure transmissions from operations to be transmitted great
distances. The equipment to be considered is a software and hardware system
that will allow pictures and data to be transmitted.
OPERATIONS ROOM
The operations room should be linked to the communications room to make
interconnection of all the methods of communication easier.
Within the Operations Room there should be suitable equipment to communicate
with a dedicated operation run by the TSU and the facility to link into another
department for joint operations.
Large screen displays should be utilised to display incoming video transmissions,
digital photographs and display the mapping and tracking systems.
Dedicated control consoles can be manned to ensure speedy flow of information
between commanders and field operations.
The intelligence database should be linked via network system from the
Intelligence Unit to a dedicated console.
Large scale maps of the country and surrounding area should be mounted on the
wall for briefing purposes.
Separate recording of all communications and data should be made during all
operations.
Scanning receivers should be linked to controllable antennas to receive signals
from undercover operations direct or via repeaters.
There are the normal tools of an Operations Rooms, fax machines, photocopiers,
computers etc. in use. These are normally installed to the client’s request.
VEHICLES
The TSU should have a selection of vehicles at its disposal to allow it to react to all
situations.
These vehicles fall into the following categories;






General surveillance
Command
Manned observation
Unmanned observation
Specialist

General Surveillance
During a surveillance operation a variety of vehicles are used, they form the basis
of the surveillance team’s efforts. Normally they are chosen from the most
common in use in the country and fitted to each officer’s needs and requests.
Generally they are equipped with covert radio communications; to allow the
officers the ability to communicate with other team members and headquarters
unobserved.

CONFIDENTIAL

page 7

Sometime these vehicles are used as unmanned surveillance vehicles and can be
fitted with the required equipment (see later section).
Generally these vehicles are issued to individual officers and rotated at regular
intervals.
These vehicles can also be wired to accept a variety of surveillance equipment
such as cameras, recorders, repeaters etc. This equipment is usually installed
prior to an operation. Making these vehicles a truly versatile item within the TSU
sphere of operations.
Command
Command vehicles can be of two types, the first being the surveillance team
leader, whose vehicle is fitted with additional equipment to allow him to direct an
operation.
This equipment can be radio repeaters, more powerful radios, in output and
flexibility, laptop computer linked to headquarters for access to the intelligence
database, or transmission of data or video images.
The second type is a dedicated Technical Surveillance Van (TSV) which is fully
equipped to allow the TSU to operate in any environment and situation and is fitted
with all the methods of communication similar to the communications room at
headquarters, video transmission and receiving equipment, recording of video and
audio.
The actual fitting of this vehicle very much depends on to day to day operations
that the TSU are likely to carry out. Therefore the vehicle is tailor made to suit the
client’s requirement and budget.
Manned Observation
These are custom built vans that are fitted out to allow officers the ability to keep
observation on a target person, location or building unobserved.
Within these vehicles the officers will have the ability to video, photograph all
occurrences and receive incoming audio from covert radio devices and the
surveillance team.
Again these vehicles are chosen from the most type in use in the country and
modified accordingly.
Unmanned Observation
When operating in hostile environments sometimes it is better to leave an
unmanned vehicle which has the ability to broadcast video and audio to another
location or vehicle which is a safe distance from the target.
These vehicles can be the general & manned surveillance vehicles or it is
considered better to have dedicated vehicles for this purpose thereby not
subjecting the operation vehicle to too much attention or detection.
Specialist
These vehicles are those that are not in daily use and kept for special operations
such as Direction Finding etc.
CONFIDENTIAL

page 8

Due to the specialist nature of these vehicles role within the TSU sometimes they
are considered to be low priority and other vehicles are modified to suit for a short
period.
SUPPORT EQUIPMENT
Within the TSU there should be a complete support organisation that the
surveillance can use and interrelate with to ensure the operation runs smoothly
and security is kept within the TSU.
There main areas of support are difficult to predefine but the following is a
suggestion;
Technical Support
Technical facilities should be in house for servicing of all equipment from radios to
recorders.
After each operation the equipment should be checked by a qualified technician
and made ready for the next assignment.
Technicians should also be trained in the surveillance techniques and methods of
deployment, thereby allowing them to be used for difficult installations of
equipment.
They can also be trained in the installation of the covert communications and
vehicle “fits” necessary within a TSU.
Research & Development
This is usually part of the technical support facility as both are closely related; the
R&D technicians can have a great part to play within the TSU by modifying existing
equipment for operation roles and developing their own range of equipment to suit
the operational theatre of operations.
Audio & Video Support
This is a specialist section dedicated to enhancing audio and video recordings to
ensure the best possible result is presented to the investigating officer.
They are also responsible for ensuring the recordings are made to the highest
quality and advising the operational teams on the best use of the equipment at
their disposal.
For evidence purposes they should be responsible for continuity of evidence and
editing recordings. Normally during a surveillance operation many hours of
recordings are made which have to be reduced to an edited version of events.
During long term audio and video surveillance their expertise is invaluable, as they
can listen live and make adjustments to ensure the best recording in poor
conditions.
They are normally recruited from the television broadcast industry where these
skills are in daily use.

CONFIDENTIAL

page 9

Transcription Unit
Within the audio & video section there will be audio recordings which need to be
transcribed for files and evidence purposes, security vetted audio typists should be
employed to transcribe these recordings.
Photographic Support
To support the photographers of the TSU a complete darkroom must be set up to
keep all the development and printing of films in house ensuring complete
security.
Darkrooms for colour, black & white should be provided. If digital photography is
to be employed by the TSU a digital suite should also be included. This could be
linked via computer to the field officer sending photographs via, landline, GSM etc.
Apart from the daily photographic and video kits in use the photographic section
should have the use of specialist cameras and long range lenses.
Intelligence Database
A complete intelligence database should be installed preferably one that has the
ability to link with the other databases within the country i.e. Police, Immigration,
Resident ID’s, Customs etc. and Interpol.
New databases are being developed on a regular basis, its important for the unit to
keep up with developments, such as the Terrorist Database developed jointly by
the Bomb Data Centre at New Scotland Yard and the Bomb Data Centre, ATF in
the United States, this database is available to law enforcement departments and
will allow the unit to exchange valuable data between itself and the main terrorist
databases in the world.
The TSU can compile its own database for use within the Intelligence section; care
should be taken when selecting the master database as some do not link without
special written software to other databases.
When the main database has been selected, the additional databases and how
they operate together should be considered, these could be; facial recognition and
comparison, fingerprint comparison, passport scanning, vehicle recognition,
photographic and video clip storage.
The main database should have its own secure environment and be able to
communicate with Intelligence officer’s computers within Headquarters, and field
officers laptop computers via modems and other methods of communication.
EQUIPMENT DATABASE
A central database of all the TSU equipment should be stored on computer with
bar coding for ease of identification, service history, operation history, loan records
etc.
Linked to the central database should be a library of all equipment that is
associated with a TSU. The officer responsible for this database should be familiar
with the manufacturers and exhibitions worldwide and make regular visits to
ensure the TSU has the best information at its fingertips and can up date its
equipment procurement programme efficiently.

CONFIDENTIAL

TRAINING SECTION
Training plays a very important part in TSU life; there is always new equipment and
techniques to be mastered to keep up with the technology available.
Regular training exercises should be planned and conducted within the department
and jointly with other sections and department to ensure complete confidence in
the equipment, techniques and each other.
Specialist instructors should be invited to train specialist personnel in such skills as
Covert Methods of Entry, lock picking, facial recognition, surveillance photography,
audio transmission etc. on a regular basis that way the TSU keeps up with the
latest techniques in daily use around the world by different departments.
PERSONAL ISSUE EQUIPMENT
Operational TSU officers should be issued with a set of equipment that reflects
their speciality i.e. lock picking, photography, audio recording etc. as well as the
basic issue, communications radios, vehicles, bodyworn recorders and
transmitters, binoculars, specialist clothing for observation duties and a tool kit.
Personal issue equipment can be as extensive as the Director wishes and the
operational role of the team dictates.
SUPPORT
The majority of equipment required will be permanently installed in the TSV
(Technical Surveillance Vehicle) and the PTSS where its prime role will be to
ensure the evidence provided by all sources is recorded and presented logically
and clearly to guarantee a successful operation.
Support equipment and personnel will also be situated at the main base of the
TSU to provide additional facilities including:
Equipment







Audio editing suite for duplication and enhancement of tapes
Video editing suite for duplication and enhancement of tapes
Battery charging facilities
Dark room with photographic developing & printing equipment
Workshop equipment for repair and servicing
Selection of equipment for loan to other units

Personnel
 Research & Development technicians to adapt and develop equipment for
a variety of uses
 Security vetted audio typists to transcribe tapes from surveillance
operations
 General administrative staff
The base will also:
 Act as a unit for operational briefings
 Train officers from other units in the correct operational use of technical
equipment and new operational techniques
 Prepare training material for other departments
 Evaluate and trial new equipment for the TSU
 Prepare evidence for presentation by case officers
CONFIDENTIAL

page 11

 Liaise with other agencies and departments for intelligence and technical
requirements
 Maintain a central database of equipment

GENERAL PURPOSE EQUIPMENT
For day-to-day operations the TSU can provide investigating and or intelligence
officers with a full technical support capability to assist them in their activities.
The TSU should be equipped to carry out any task from loan of binoculars to
implementation of a full technical surveillance on suspects, buildings, vehicles, etc.
A full technical surveillance will entail initial reconnaissance of the location, liaison
with the case officers to establish what they wish to achieve then deployment of
the correct equipment to assist them. This will include covert methods of entry,
inserting of audio transmitters and microphones and possibly video cameras and
establishing the observation base for the collection of this information.
A vast amount of the equipment in daily use will be multi purpose and used in
many different situations.
Ideally, some of this equipment should be in kit form to allow fast response to any
given situation. Kits should be made for the following:
 Audio surveillance
Wireless with receivers and recorders
Hard wired with microphones, amplifiers and recorders
 Video Surveillance
Transmitters and receivers with an option of remote control
CCD cameras for day and night operation, with recorders, monitors
and a selection of short and long range lenses.
 Photographic Surveillance
Stills 35 mm & digital camera and video camcorder with a selection
of long range lenses and image intensifiers
 Covert Methods of Entry

TRAINING AND CONSULTANCY
Training services for an important and often integral part of implementing
successful security operations. A major factor in our philosophy is the belief that
training and the understanding of products and technology are critical factors and
major strengths in finding successful security solutions.
Our highly trained personnel are called upon by many government security
organisations to give advice and consultation. We have organised and developed a
highly successful training programme designed to benefit government security
personnel at many levels not only for operational techniques but also important
stages of maintenance.
The training is based on a flexibility that is primarily tailored to each and every
client’s requirements, in country at the client’s establishment, covering the theory
and practical conditions which the end-user will experience.
Our training team has active experience in many theatres of operations, military,
police, civil, including: surveillance, counter surveillance, counter terrorism, close
protection, intervention, EOD/IEDD and forensic investigation etc.
Instructors are drawn from various backgrounds and work as a unit very closely
with the end-user to produce training packages that are individually tailored to
meet the client’s exact requirements.

TSU OPERATIONAL TRAINING
Training forms an important and often integral part of implementing a successful
security operation.
Understanding the equipment and technology are critical factors and major
strengths in finding successful security solutions.
In order to compile a detailed training schedule, it is imperative to find an
organisation, which not only has the requisite technical experience but also has the
personnel who have been actively involved in this type of operational role. They
would also be expected to assist with setting up an in-house facility for
continuation training.
The training must be based on local conditions and requirements and is flexible
enough to be incorporated should a live operation occur during the training period.
Training must be comprehensive, covering both the theory and the practical
implementation of all the equipment and techniques.
Attached is a list of courses that should be the core of the TSU training
programme. Other specialist courses can be added, as they are required.
The main course is designed to run over a period to be agreed, at the same time
there are specialist courses that will be running alongside the main course.
This will allow the operational team to take part in a course designed to give them
an in-depth view of the operational side of a Technical Support Unit.
The strategy, tactics and techniques taught will ultimately be derived from the
many experiences and situations the instructors have been involved with.
The subject matter can, if required, be tailored to meet the needs, aims and
objectives of any specific organisation or team.
During the course, the following subjects will be explained, integrated, practised
and developed to local conditions during all phases to form an essential part of the
overall training.
Surveillance is an ever-changing scenario of events, which relies on the operatives
using an array of skills and tactics to ensure the security and successful conclusion
to any operation.
Throughout any surveillance operation, it is vital that good quality intelligence is
obtained and developed. This is to provide the surveillance team commander and
investigating officer with the opportunity to determine some of the habits, and
activities of the subject under surveillance, in order that operatives and equipment
can be strategically deployed.
Surveillance is manpower intensive, expensive to maintain and must be used
wisely. It should be considered as an aide to the investigating officer and must be
conducted with a structured and methodical approach. With the ever-changing
scenario, the failure or incorrect deployment of operatives and equipment can
result in compromise, loss of vital intelligence or evidence and destroy much of the
surveillance strategy that has taken place. This could lead to complete failure,
tragic consequences, and much embarrassment.
The surveillance operation is also vital for obtaining not only intelligence, but must
act as a focal point for collating evidence against any perpetrators who are likely to
face judicial process.

CONFIDENTIAL

page 16

Therefore, accuracy, continuity and above all the integrity as to how that
intelligence and evidence was obtained is crucial.
Charter and Organisation – Command and Control
Before the course, the instructors will have discussed with the students’ Head of
Department/Organisation, their specific needs, aims and objectives, plus roles and
functions expected of the students. These will then be incorporated into the
course and complemented with the appropriate command and control structure to
ensure the students’ methods of operation meet the department/organisation's
requirements. Briefing and debriefs, planning and preparation as well as the
setting of investigation and surveillance objectives will be a regular feature of the
course.

Instructors
All the instructors are former members of specialist Police or Military investigation
and surveillance units.
They are vastly experienced, have spent many years at the planning and cuttingedge of small and large scale surveillance operations and have the most up to date
technical and tactical knowledge.
Many of the instructors have been responsible for successfully presenting
evidence to national and international tribunals and have extensive experience in
the many forms of counter surveillance techniques used by surveillance aware
persons.
Health and Safety
The health, safety, and welfare of students are of paramount importance. To this
end, students and any observers will be required to conform to the course Health,
Safety, and Welfare Policy.
Failure to comply with any safety instruction or the contents of the course policy
will result in a student or observer being required to leave the course.
There is also a Substance Use and Misuse Policy applicable to the course and
students and observers may be subjected to pre-deployment, post deployment or
random drug and alcohol testing. This testing will be mandatory following an
accident or incident.
Additional Training Courses
TSU Technicians Course – This will last for two weeks and run with the main
operational section, it will allow the technicians on the team to concentrate on the
daily repairs and maintenance of the equipment and bring them up to first line
maintenance levels.
Technical Surveillance Counter Measures – An in depth course tailored to the
counter surveillance teams with more hands on practical, covering sweep and
search techniques, telephone and PABX analysis, cable checking, vehicle
operations, exercise with the TSU operational team in covert concealment,
defeating counter measures.
