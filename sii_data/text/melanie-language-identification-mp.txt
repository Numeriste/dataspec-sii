MELANIE – Language Identification, MP
Functionality
Speech signals can be analysed according to the language prevailing in the speech.
For each speech signal, an overall score and probability is estimated. In addition,
these values can also be estimated for any time interval.

Training of Models
Goal

Training is performed in order to optimise the models on the
languages and channel of the application.

Training Data

The training data must be labeled according to the language in
the speech signal. The data must be representative and as
similar as possible to the data of the application. A minimum of
one hour of data is required for each language.

Trained Models

In case of insufficient data, trained models for a set of
languages can be provided to use the system from scratch.

Technical Data
OperatingSystem Available on Windows XP and Linux
Processing Time
• On a P4; 3GHz, 1GB RAM computer
• Classifying 10 different languages
• 1/7 of real time; i.e. a signal of 7 minutes length is processed in one minute
Recognition Rate The recognition rate depends on the number of languages, on
the similarities and charactistics of the languages, and on the
speech quality. For example, when distinguishing 5 languages
in radio quality, an accuracy of 80 % can be obtained.

Consequently, this means that a recording with a signal length of 20
minutes can be fully classified in one minute.
