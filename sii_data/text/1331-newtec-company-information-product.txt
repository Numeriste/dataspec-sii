sites are located in hotspots or remote
areas around the world that have no access to terrestrial communication
infrastructure.

The amount of data,voice and video exchanged between the headquarters
and remote sites has grown substantially along the wide number of
applications.

Government and defense customers continuously seek solutions to
increase satellite link efficiency, to find available satellite bandwidth
and to drive down satellite bandwidth costs. Whilst in operation the
satellite link needs to be available at all timed to assure mission critical
communications.

The fixed communications establish a backbone link between
headquarters and remote sites combining a number of
services that are key to the success of the operation and the
welfare of the deployed personnel.

Applications for fixed communications are:
ISR Data Backhaul and Exchange Networks
Morale, Welfare and Recreation
Disaster Recovery Networks
Multi-Service Government Networks
Border Security and Surveillance
Mission Support Networks
National Election Networks
Education, Distant Learning and Scientific Networks
Civil, Humanitarian and NGO Networks
