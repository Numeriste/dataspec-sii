Media: newspapers, magazines, radio, television etc.
Web-based communities and user generated content: social-networking
sites, video sharing sites, wikis, blogs etc.
Public Data: government reports, budgets, demographics, hearings,
legislative debates, press conferences, speeches, marine and aeronautical
safety warnings, environmental impact statements and contract awards.
Professional and Academic: conferences, professional associations,
academic papers, and subject matter experts.
Geospatial Open Source: maps, atlases, gazetteers, port plans, navigation
data, human terrain data, environmental data, commercial imagery etc.

Why Is OSINT The Internet Important?
The growth of social media, social networking
sites, media sharing sites, and their ease of access
through various devices.
–  Whether its riots in Egypt, political protest in Iran or
terror group recruitment, OSINT provides a relatively
cheap and immediate form of intelligence for the
community.
•  Al Jazeera reporter Dan Nolan tweeted during Egyptian
clashes on 2 February: "Soldiers left 4 tanks outside
museum. Now anti gov. protestors sitting on top. Main battle
about 100m further toward gala st.”

We must collect now!

How Good is Our OSINT Capability?
•  Lack Defined Processes
–  Unreliable Data, Sub-Par Processes

•  Lack of Automation
–  Wasted Time, No Re-Use

•  Overwhelmed by Unstructured Content
–  Over focus on Machine Learning and AI
–  Neglecting Structure in Unstructured Enrichment
–  Ignoring Structure to Influence the Enrichment Pipeline

•  Improper Priorities
–  OSINT is a low priority compared to other INTs.
–  Programs invest too heavily on manual efforts
–  Programs focus on making sense of messy collected data

What Do We Need to Do?
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 

Automate the collection process
Get more structure into your pipeline
Remove noise from the data
Improve accuracy of the data pipeline
Leverage multiple ontologies
Seamlessly discover information across
structured and unstructured data
•  Crowdsource to improve enrichment
•  Push OSINT services to the people

UNCLASSIFIED

Automate the Collection Processes
•  Deploy On-Line, On-Demand OSINT Services
–  Rapid Service Creation
•  Data is changing, too many sources, changing environment

–  On-Line
•  Leverage these services across the enterprise

–  On-Demand
•  Initiate new data collections
•  Query Enriched Content

•  Evaluate and Refine Processes
•  Invent New Processes

UNCLASSIFIED

Finding Structure In the Unstructured
•  Broad Crawls
–  Use common data
•  H1, H2, Metadata tags – title, keywords

•  Targeted URL Crawls
–  Use the HTML tags to find structure on
targeted crawls
•  Relationships, many to ones, dozens of data
points

–  Requires an Extraction Browser

•  Always keep raw data
10

UNCLASSIFIED

Remove Noise From The Data
•  Remove advertising through
pattern matching
•  Don’t load Noise
•  Crowdsourcing, feedback loops,
systems that learn based on user
behavior

UNCLASSIFIED

UNCLASSIFIED

Improve Accuracy of the Data Pipeline
•  Use the Structured Data Points to help the Pipeline’s
Accuracy
•  Allow the Pipeline to make recursive calls
–  Re-collect or collect new content and call other portions of the
pipeline as your workflow see’s fit.

•  Trust, trustworthy data, leverage less trustworthy data
–  An OSINT phone number lead to the death of Abu Musab alZarqawi, former al Qaeda in Iraq leader
–  A Google search on an IP address of interest returned a link to
GhostNet’s central management console.

•  Teach Your Pipeline Applications
–  NLP technologies have used data collected to learn

12

UNCLASSIFIED

Leverage Multiple Ontologies
•  Use Ontologies to Influence the Pipeline
–  Human Terrain Mapping Example of a news
story

•  Allow different perspectives to process
and evaluate data differently
–  Clearance means something different to
truck driver than it does to someone in CIA
–  A ‘Tank’ means something different to an
infantry man than to a logistician.

UNCLASSIFIED

Seamlessly Discover Information Across
Structured and Unstructured Data
•  One Box Example

•  Source Selection

14

UNCLASSIFIED

Crowdsource to Improve Enrichment
•  Enable people to rank the results
–  How accurate is the data
–  Were the right data elements collected
–  Is the Ontology Accurate
–  Is the translation correct
–  Manual Entity Tagging
–  Tag Finders – RSS Feed example of Machine
Learning

•  Use that Feedback to Improve the Collection
and Enrichment Pipeline
UNCLASSIFIED

UNCLASSIFIED

Push OSINT Services to the People
On-Line, On-Demand OSINT Services Environment
•  Web Services
•  End User Environment Integrations
–  I2, Palantir, Thetus, ESRI, Visual Analytics, Inspire,
MarkLogic etc.

•  Application Access
–  Data validation, data collection, integration

•  Federated Search
–  Internal, OSINT, Subscription, PKI etc.

•  Browser Plugins

Summary
•  We must not miss out on the internet as a
source for intelligence
•  Analysts must have an interface for
discovering valuable content and that
content must be tagged and delivered in a
manner that supports the knowledge
discovery process of the analyst.
•  We must start today
