A NEW GENERATION SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
FOR INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS, TAKING ADVANTAGE OF
MOORE’S LAW

André Scholtz

Content
• A changing world…
• Current solutions, measured against
decision criteria
• The ideal solution, and the new
architecture
• Summary and conclusion

A changing world
• Terrorism threat:
– Flexible, transnational network structure
– Enabled by modern technology
– Interconnectivity between groups

A changing world …
• Communication
– Any place, any time, through various means
– 70% of communications by 2009 through wireless
and broadband (Gartner)
– Dual mode Wifi/mobile phones; dual mode
satellite/mobile phones
– Skype, VoIP and encryption
– Instant messaging
– UMTS, UMB, OFDM

• Tomorrow shall be different, yet again!

A changing world…
• Moore!s law – double every 18 – 24 months
• Storage
–
–
–
–

1956: 5 MByte disk storage at USD10!000 (IBM)
Q1 2007: 1 TByte on 5 platter HDD (Hitachi)
Less than USD1 per GByte
21 TB (raw) in 4U 19” (soon 31.5 TB) available

• Processing power

–

1997: 500 nm technology
2007: 45 nm technology (Intel)
Nanotechnology 30 nm
Quad Core 1.8 GHz CPU, 2 x 4 MB cache
commercially available

Changes around us
• "Everything that can be invented has been invented."
"""—"Charles H. Duell, Commissioner, U.S. Office of
Patents, 1899.
• "This 'telephone' has too many shortcomings to be
seriously considered as a means of communication."
"""—"Western Union internal memo, 1876
• "I see no progress in this industry. These clocks are
no faster than the ones they made a hundred years
ago." """—" Henry Ford, while visiting a museum.
• "There is no reason anyone would want a computer
in their home." """—"Ken Olson, president/founder of
Digital Equipment Corp., 1977

Current solutions
• Most often dedicated hardware
–
–
–
–

Recorders and dedicated DSP cards
Switch matrices
DCME!s (in case of satellite interception)
Fax and data demodulation units

• Often stated as latest technology (but only
latest chips in an old architecture)
• Result
– Strongly vendor dependant
– Difficult/expensive to support
– Difficult to adapt/expand
=> Not suitable for tomorrow…

Investment/decision criteria
• Intelligence
– Will the system provide us with unique
intelligence required cost-effectively?

• Investment protection
– Will our investment be protected in a world
of changing technological, threat and
communications environments – can it
adapt?

• Support
– Will we be able to support the system in
the long run cost effectively?

Conclusion
• Did not know yesterday what we know today
• In 10 year!s time things will be vastly different
again
• Existing solutions are not suitable
• New architecture must:
– Address investment criteria
• Unique intelligence value
• Adaptable to changing threat and communication
environments
• Supportable

– Use benefits of Moore!s law to be relevant for the
next 10-15 years

The ideal solution
Changing communications environment
(Satellite, landline, mobile; circuit and packet switched;
different protocols)

Suitable active/passive gateways
(E1/T1, E3/DS3, STM-1/-4, IP)

Off-the-shelf Processing and Storage
(Networked architecture; distributed implementation;
content capturing - records and stores everything;
content enrichment – speech analysis, etc)

Integration API
Industry leading applications
(Intelligence mining, extraction)
