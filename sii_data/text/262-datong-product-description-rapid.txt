Operational Benefits
Real-timeGPStracking

TRACKVIEW is a secure web based mapping
application utilizing Google Maps® for live tracking or
past tracking of targets when using the RAPID device.
TRACKVIDA is an intuitive, intelligent way to view
real-time GPS data, and analyse the target GPS data
during or after operations. TRACKVIEVV also allows
the user full command and control of the RAPiD
device via the GPRS network.

'Over-the-air commanding and configuration
High level of security for target data protection
Tracking information can be viewed by multiple
users simultaneously
Reversegeo-code of target position to display street name
Journey and 'stops' analysis

TRACKVIEW is backed by a secure database to hold
all the tracking information. This database works
automatically in the background with the tracker, to
upload any new fixes whenever there is a GPRS
connection. This means that the tracking data is
always available to the user, without having to
manually dial in to the unit

Intuitive past tracking feature for operational analysis
User selectable map display format
Clear concise interface
Intuitive and easy to use
Mobile web pages available (for use on mobile phones
