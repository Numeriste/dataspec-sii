Link Aggregator

(4) 10/100 Links to
(4) GigaBit SFP Monitor Ports
Net Optics 10/100 Link Aggregator provides a comprehensive platform for
monitoring multiple network links while leveraging monitoring tool resources.
Access for up to four 10/100Mbps full-duplex links (eight half-duplex data
streams)is visible to 4 GigaBit SFP based monitor ports. A pool of monitoring tools
with differing functions enables you to consolidate network performance, threat
management and VoIP analysis functions into one easy to use device.
Installing monitoring tools on individual links in the network is often time
consuming and not within the budget. The SFP based monitor ports allow you to
use the copper or fiber based monitoring tools you already own. Simply connect
them to the Link Aggregator when and where you need them most. At least one
SFP monitor Port kit is required when purchasing the 10/100 Link Aggregator.
All network port pairs in the Link Aggregator feature Net Optics’ exclusive Zero
DelayTM technology. Any loss of power to is transparent to the network, and does
not affect the flow of traffic on the link. Each network pair fails-open. Even if
power is lost and reapplied, Zero Delay ensures network traffic uptime. For
additional reliability, redundant power supplies are a standard feature.

Passive, Secure Technology

• Supports full-duplex monitoring of four links, increasing
monitoring efficiency
• Provides complete full-duplex visibility at 10 or 100 Mbps without datastream
interference or introducing a point of failure
• Passes all traffic (including errors) from all layers for comprehensive
troubleshooting
• No IP address is needed for the Tap or monitoring device, enhancing monitoring
security
• Redundant power ensures monitoring uptime

Ease of Use

• LED indicators show redundant power, speed, link, and activity status
• Front-mounted connectors support easy installation and operation
• Small form-factor pluggable (SFP) monitor port connectors increase monitoring
options
• Compatible with all major manufacturers’ monitoring devices, including protocol
analyzers, probes, and intrusion detection/prevention systems
