INTRODUCTION INTO FORENSIC AUDIO
Nowadays law enforcement and security other widely use open and covert sound recordings of speech
communications for cnme investigation or other secunty purposes. The records received by law enforcement
agencies turns into court evidences. A branch of forensic science called Audio Forensics (Audio Phonelics, Audio
Acoustics) processes such audio evidences.
Forensic audio is audio services for legal applications. Forensic audio breaks down into four main categories.

SPEECH ENHANCEMENT: Digital and analog processing to restore verbal clarity and make tapes easier to
understand in a courtroom situation.
SPEECH DECODING: Methods that can be used to decode noisy speech and convert It to a reasonably
accurate and complete written copy or transcript.
AUTHENTICITY: Aural, electronic and physical examination of an audio files to prove that 1t has not been
tampered with, altered, or otherwise changed from its original state. Another common authenticity challenge 1s to
determine whether a given recording was indeed made on a given machine.
VOICE IDENTIFICATION: Voice ID is the soence that attempts to determine whether the recorded voice
belongs to the susp1oous speaker or not. Voice ID 1s based on the theory that v0tce of each person 1s as unique as
fingerpnntsor DNA and depends on the individual features of speech production organs, the shape of vocal tract,
mouth cavity, pronunciation skills, regional accent etc.
