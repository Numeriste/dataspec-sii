[vim TRACER
MCRTRACER has been developed by AREA to satisfy the upcoming need of LEAS
to track targets movements by means of GPS and GPRSSystems.
MCR Tracer full integration in the MCR Voice & Data Monitoring- Center enables
LEA operators to leverage the power of an unified interface for all the information
(Voice, Data, Positioning) related t o the target.

GEOGRAPHICAL TRACKING OF "#R$%"
A TACTICAL TOOL
The geographical localization of monitored
targets is nowadays one of the most important
tools in investigation activities.
AREA has developed in house a solution
to pinpoint someone'sposition down to 10
meters using devices so small to fit in the palm
of one hand. &$' Tracer is made up of:
• The Tracking Device (TD) providing
localization data

1. MER Player Interface (Area Monitoring Center)
The full integration of Tracer with MDR Voice
& Data Monitoring Center provides the best
performances and efficiency, allowing LEA
operators to use the same NCR Player
interface for all kinds of monitoring activities:
fixed and mobile telephony and 'P data
interceptions, localization tracking services,
live audio and video. etc.

The TDs are installed on vehicles or others

2. MER Tracer Anywhere (Web User-Interface)
By means of a specific Web-based
application, it is possible to render on maps
of the geographical data belonging to the
targets from any IF-enabled device (incl.
smartphones I Phone) and without a complete
monitoring center infrastructure.

moving Objects, allowing Law Enforcement
Agencies to acquire relevant data
concerning vehicles movements: history
and real-time monitoring, date and time of
all movements, average speed, real-time
localization on maps, etc.

TRACER ARCHITECTURE
The data captured by &$) "*+,! are sent to a
MCR system for centralized storage, registration
and authentication.
The LEA operator can access these data using
the following interfaces, even in parallel:

LOCALISATION AND TRANSMISSION
TECHNOLOGIES
Tracer is based on a combined use of the
two main localization network protocols
(GPS and GSM) in order to grant the highest
performances and reliability:
• GPS system offers the fastest targets
localization, higher precision and
continuous update of date, time and other
basic tracking parameters
• G & cell-based localization is less precise.
but can exploit much wider network coverage
and the network signal is not affected by
weather or environmental factors.
Two different transmission modes are supported:
• GPRS
• SW
Localization data are transmitted by default
via GPRS. In case of missing GPRS signal,
data are sent via CMS.
To grant the best GSM coverage and system
availability, two SIM cards from different
operators can be installed on board.
If both networks are unavailable.
localization data are cached on the Tracer
device and forwarded when the connection
is re-established. Data are sent at
configurable intervals.

REMOTE CONTROL
Complete remote control of the device is
possible via mobile phone, MCA Player or
MCP Tracer Anywhere using sMs or GPRS
connectivity.
Remote firmware upgrade and configuration,
with a wide range of customizable parameters
separated Admin & User access and rules.
HIGH RELIABILITY, AVAILABILITY

stored data and the live tracking of the moving
targets.
THE ANYWHERE APPROACH
Thanks to a dedicated web server within the
MCR infrastructure, access to data collected
by MCA Tracer is granted from any device
connected to the Internet and equipped with
a standard browser: PC/Notebook from the
office, Smartphone/iPhone from the field or
from a remote location, etc.
A Virtual Private Network guarantees
maximum flexibility and data access without
compromises in terms of security.
MAPS
The integration between MCA Tracer Anywhere
and the world's leading vendors of digital maps
(Google, Microsoft) allows users to visualize
the position of their targets in many differ ways,
such as:
• Google Maps with Maps" view
• Google Maps with satellite' view
• Google Maps 'Street view'

• Microsoft Virtual Earth
• Microsoft Virtual Earth with satellite views
• Microsoft Virtual Earth with aerial photography
TARGETS VISUALIZATION
The rendering of targets positions can be fully
customized through different parameters and
according to the most suitable investigation
approach. For example, the operator can
choose to visualize:
•
•
•
•

Single, defined GPS positions
Complete travels
Time periods and related movements
Journeys within selected points

LIVE CHASING AND USE OF MULTIPLE TARGETS
Chasing and pursuing targets is made easier
thanks to the ability to track several targets at
the same time.
Several available options allow operators
to assign defined targets to dedicated
visualization modes, according to investigators
needs and operations scenarios.
Two maps can be open on the same screen,
allowing the parallel view of separate targets.
When targets are in the same geographical
area, they will be shown on the same map,
using different colors.

The great variety
of possible
visualizations
guarantees the
highest precision
in pinpointing
and monitoring
the target
movements.

CONFIGURATION
Thanks to MCP Tracer Anywhere, the tracking
devices (Tracer) can be easily configured from

other organizations

MCR STUDIO is designed for LEAs needing a
powerful tool to analyze and correlate data
collected through:
• telephony and lp interception activities
• G&si"!s localization of nomadic/mobile targets
• telephony and I P retained data from Telcos
and lSPs
• third-parties database import (i.e. credit
cards payments, toll payments, airlines
tickets and boarding cards).
Besides the great capability to fit different
investigation approaches. MCA studio added
value is the effectiveness in finding out both
direct and indirect relationships among
subjects, identifying behavioral models.
MCA studio is delivered either as a pure
analysis system or, more often, integrated with
turn-key Monitoring Centers.
The first option fits in scenarios where ()*
Studio is used to analyze databases not
continuously updated.
In the second case, LEAs greatly benefit from
integration since analysis procedures can be
repeated automatically and periodically.
AREA data-mining solution is very modular and
flexible, so ()* studio installations range from
a few PCs to several servers and workstations.
according to the amount of data to be treated
Key factors for NCR studio spreading among
LEAs are its usable user-interface and its
capability to treat huge amount of data without
requiring footprint server farms

AND ANALYSISTOOLS
Thanks to ()* studio integration with AREA
Monitoring Center, analysis can be performed

on current intercepted communications,
including new calls, e
chats and IRIs.
In so doing, users work always on updated
information so that analysis results represent
behaviors of suspects in real-time.
LEAs benefit from convergence of rendering
and analysis tools as users can start new
analysis at any time while monitoring new
intercepted sessions. Similarly, users can
simply click output provided by MCR studio
to access and see communications linked to
analysis results.
()* Studio takes advantage from
security and anti-tampering mechanisms
implemented in AREA Monitoring Center.
After Authentication, LEA users can only
analyze data related to investigation
activities they have been assigned.

WORKFLOW OF ANAL -sis PROCEDURES
()* Studio has proved its effectiveness and
quickness in analyzing huge amount of data.
MCR Studio enables LEAs to carry out
complete analysis activities simply by
following pre-configured processes.
Main steps are:
• import printouts and ‚P data provided by
Telcos. or coming from third-party database;
• verify database consistence and eliminate
not relevant data:
• apply any of the pre-configured analysis
models or create new ones;
• select the most suitable graphical layout to
render the analysis results:
• save the data resulting from analysis
procedures, together with their graphical
output.
()* Studio comes with an advanced and
very user-friendly GUI.
Thanks to this key feature, even complex
inquiries can be represented as flow charts.
Results are displayed as grids, matrixes and
relational graphs. Moreover, it is possible to
check partial results of each analysis step
and optimize standard analysis models

DATABASE PREPARATION
Users rely on many wizards to import files
in different formats and from third-party
databases. MCA studio supports TXT.
Microsoft Excel®, Microsoft Word®, Adobe®
PDF, XML. As far as database format is
concerned, MCR Studio handles Microsoft
SQL Server®, Postgre SQL, OleOB sources
(es. Microsoft Access®), Odbc sources.
READY-TO-USE ANALYSISMODELS
MCA Studio provides several ways to describe
entities on which analysis models apply, such
as investigated subjects details, including
owned SIMs and other electronic identities (for
example E-mail addresses and SIP U RI),
Users can select among many readyto-use analysis models, depending on
investigation cases (for example, frequency
of communication among subjects and
identification of direct and indirect relations for
organized crime).
Besides taking advantage of established
analysis methods, advanced users can create
enhanced models by composing several
filtering and correlation operations. New
procedures can be saved and shared among
users of the same work-group.
EXAMPLES OF ANALYSIS PROCEDURES
Some examples of meaningful analysis
models that can be carried out by following
ready to use templates are:
• searCh for specific contents among
thousands of intercepted sessions and
IRIs (i.e. key-word among e
numbers among IRIs):
• analyze and correlate printouts related to
different BTSs, to point out movements of
suspects while using mobile phones;
• find out relationships among suspects by
merging and correlating IRIs and printouts
to obtain a graphical representation of
connections;
• identify 'chained events" and recurring
behaviors by investigating on crimes (i.e.
sequence of calls among suspects linked to
hierarchy in a group);
• represent on cartography the subjects

data are available (i.e. display on maps the
position of BTSs covering places in which
suspects are making calls);
• put together movements of subjects by
analyzing credit card payments and
boarding cards of airlines.
As Internet communication services are
increasingly used to exchange sensitive
information, AREA continuously includes
analysis models by leveraging specific
features of 'P services
OUTPUT OF ANALYSIS
In order to make the results of analysis
procedures immediately understandable, $%&
Studio supports many graphical output layouts.
The most used ones are:
• matrix, to represent the frequency of contact
among a group of subjects
• bar charts, to count how many times a
certain interesting condition or event applies
• Gantt charts, to display timeline of events or
communications involving subjects
• graphical charts, to display relationships
among subjects together with the way used
to communicate and the number of contacts
• r a p s , displaying places where subjects are
located when communicate with others
MCA Studio enables the export and archiving
of databases obtained by applying any
analysis method.
In so doing, LEAs can consolidate
investigation milestones and evidences.
Moreover. $%& Studio exports the graphical
representation of any analysis result using file
formats supported by Microsoft Off ce® suite.

MCRCAPTOR
Given the increasing use of Internet, LEAs need a Monitoring Center capable to
effectively carry out 'P interceptions, which nowadays represent a strategic tool to
provide a real added value to investigation activities,
AREA has developed the MCR CAPTOR family of probes to support LEAS in their II
(Lawful Interception) activities requiring lp data acquisition; MCR Captor probes are
totally integrated in the MCR Voice & Data Monitoring Center,
MCR CAPTOR TARGET DEFINITION
MCR Captor enables LEAs to use different
approaches to 'P data interception.

MDR Captor IF Probes installed in an Isp
network allow to:
• acquire IF streams up to 10 Gbps
• apply real time filtering rules to extract
specified ‚P sessions
• forward captured content to MCR server

Investigation Approach
This approach is usually based on the
monitoring of well known targets, previously
identified by means of investigation, in
order to collect evidences, discover social
relationships and find hints to create other
targets.
The triggering rule can be an IF address, a
Radius Login ID, an e-mail address, a chat
or a VolP ID or telephone number, etc.

MCR CAPTOR INTEGRATION
MCR Captor family of probes is fully
integrated with other MCR Voice and Data
Monitoring Center components, providing
complete Communication monitoring and
analysis functionalities.
Probes Management
Centralized installation provides GUI interface
to managq the whole system of MCR Captor
probes deployed in the network, configure
Targets, and monitor health status.
Content Inspection and Analysis
MCA Player provides extensive functionalities
to access CC and CDR of intercepted targets,
being them IF or Voice, offering advanced
features for decoding, presenting and filtering
of data. NCR Studio is the data-mining tools to
analyze target's social relationships and build
personalized analysis patterns.

Intelligence Approach
This approach is usually based on the
monitoring of communication content of
targets that are not identified yet. This kind
of interception applies in Crime Prevention
and Homeland security, as it is useful both
to discover suspect behaviors and to identify
the subjects they belong to, by means of
content monitoring.
The target can be email subject, chat
content, generic word spotting in complete
stream, type of communication protocol,
etc..

Centralized storage
MCA server provides storage, security and antitampering signature on recorded data, accordingly
to specific country legislation requirements

MLK ! - U R APPLICATION SCENARIOS
Example 1 Pirate Web Site
An example is the monitoring of a pirate web
site traffic. LEAs requirement was to trace
every access to a pirate website, and collect
all the traffic generated by those users, to
discriminate relevant targets from occasional
visitors.
The constraint in this process is the capability
to automatically target the web site which was
not always on-line and whose 'P address was
dynamic.
Establishing a trigger monitoring DNS traffic
allowed to identify those IP addresses
accessing the specific web site: those 1P
Addresses were addressed as targets, from
that point on, capturing entire traffic generated,
allowing LEAs to identify relevant users, and
obtain their ID (email, chat..)
Example 2: Word spotting (protocol based)
MCA Captor can process a whole aggregated
'P stream and extract the contents (such as
H n P pages or e
words are detected. Moreover, in order to
focus on specific communications channel,
the combination of more triggers is extremely
important. In this experience LEAs, needed
to search specific words, but to limit false
positive matches, traffic analyzed was
restricted to Instant Messaging. Webmail and
Mail protocols.

FLEXIBILITY AND SCALABILITY
MCR Captor can be easily adaptec to all
the changes that can occur in number of
monitored targets, protocols and 1SP network
modifications.
MCR Captor can support interception
activities carried Out simultaneously by
different LEAs thanks to the capability to
manage a huge number of concurrent
interception instances.
MCR CAPTOR MAIN F#("UR#
System reliability
MCA adopts an advanced automatic backup
policy and a RAID 5 mechanism is configured
on probes to avoid data loss. Moreover the
handover capability is redounded in order to
avoid that a single fault can affect the whole
system recording capacity.
Security
MCP Captor is configured to be protected
from any virus threats. malware in general
and hackers attacks.
On probes, servers and workstations a toplevel anti-virus software is installed and a
firewall infrastructure is properly configured
according to the latest policies issued by
authoritative IT security companies and
communities.

MCA V1810 is AREAs new digital recording and interactive management platform for video interception.
The solution has been specifically designed and developed for LEAs and includes typical interceptionrelated features such as:
• P o w e r f u l tools for the management of transcriptions and comments about the recorded
events, while preserving the original without
any manipulation (digital signature)
• P r i n t o u t s of the intercepted/recorded events
• R e p o r t generator for easy creation of investigation-related into summary, customizable with
templates
• F r i e n d l y user interface hides a powerful sw
engine
• M u l t i - l i n g u a l support

Real
Monitoring of all active video cameras gives the opera
tor a complete view of all monitored locations. Cameras can b e managed according to the operators
needs: they can be zoomed in or out; they can be
tilted and panned (PTZ control).
MCR VISIO already integrates control protocols for
Axis and PANAsONIC cameras. Customization for
use with specific cameras can be arranged for specific projects.

!

MCR VISIO client-server architecture enables the handling of multiple activities. collecting inputs from several sources, in a single centralized infrastructure. with
evident economic and organizational advantages. It
can be adapted to a wide range of analog and digital
cameras and supports real-time video target streaming along with analysis of stored files.
The large selection of recording methods and options
allows the operator to customize video shots in order
to adapt the interception to specific needs and application scenarios.

Recorded Video files
Operators can retrieve and manage at any time stored
video files. The choice of start time for playback can
be easily made: the timeline (with zoom-in functions, to
allow higher granularity) included in every recorded
video and the bookmark feature, give operators the
freedom to browse among time intervals and to play,
store or export parts of a selected video.
Recording time can be planned in advance, by telling
MCR VIslO the daily schedule of an interception activity, for each camera currently connected to the system.
Recording mode can be defined: i.e. Continuous recording. Recording upon movement. etc.
Video recordings are particularly helpful when combined with NCR VISlO muftiview feature, for cross
analysis of multiple recordings.

MCR v i s i o offers many innovative and unique features, including:

ADVANCED MOTION DETECTION
)(* VISIO offers a n advanced recording mode,
based on the definition of active areas on the screen,
with inclusion/exclusion zones. The operator can select areas of interest where MCR V15l0 will focus its
motion detection engine, with user-defined motion
thresholds to start recording. These active areas also
can benefit from an automatic zoom in case motion is
detected.
Recordings made with active areas, share the same
modes (i.e. Continuous recording. Recording upon
movement, etc.) as other recordings.

Muinview
MCR v i s o manages efficiently different multi camera
modes. Operators can view one single camera window, or multiple cameras. When more than one camera window is present, the operator is allowed to configure windows layout and priority, for both real-time
playback and saved video recordings. Each video
window is actually a tab which can be detached from
the main window and moved onto other monitors, if
available (i.e. real-time playback of an investigation on
a screen, and transcription of a report on video frames
of another investigation, on the second screen).
CONTENT SEARCH
With the search feature, operators can look for a specific content among MCR VlslO's recordings, by applying filter criteria, including search for date, time,
relevance, bookmark or transcription.

MULTIMEDIA CLIENT-SERVER MODE
INTEGRATED LIVE AUDIO
MCR Visio also accepts input from multiple Audio
sources and specific audio+video streams can b e
merged together, i.e. for lips-reading. These two inputs
can then be exported in a single and synchronized A/
V output file.
Time-based bookmarks (related to a specific events)
can be associated with multiple audio+video tracks.
Operators can write notes and comments for any single (audio OR video) source.

MCP VISIO infrastructure was designed to consider
different bandwidth availabilities. When contents are
stored remotely and operators need network connections to access them, Visio's client-server architecture
can detect the network's throughput and modify its
access speed to allow operators to get the best quality
videos that the network can guarantee. This feature
doesn't affect stored videos, that won't change their
real quality: only the network transmitted contents will
adapt to the line conditions.

MCR system is a cloud of two types of
components, connected via local or
geographical networks (LAN/WAN) in a
multiple client-server/3tiers/P2P architecture:

MCR system is ready from the very first startup to intercept and acquire contents coming
from targets and networks of different nature,
as explained in the scheme below. AREA's
technology is constantly kept up to date,
along with the evolution of telecommunication
and 'P networks.

1. MER Server. the recording unit
aimed to acquire, record and store
telecommunication and 'P data exchanged
by a large number of targets
2. MER Player, a user-friendly application that

FLEXIBILITY AND ECALABILITY
The MCP system is based on a multi-layer
architecture intrinsically modular, flexible and
scalable, which is able to adapt in real-time
to the different needs that can emerge during
interception activities.
A single MCR server recording unit is
capable to receive several voice and lp
streams at the same time, generated by
multiple targets. There's no theoretical limit to
the number of linked MCP servers that can
work in parallel, making possible to add new
targets at any time.
The key feature of flexibility between number
of targets and number of LEA operators is
completely realized in MCR system: multiple
operators can monitor the same target and
multiple targets can be monitored by the
same operator.
In this way, the system can be dimensioned
according to the number of operators,
regardless the number of targets.
MCR system is totally scalable, according to
the following parameters:
• Number of targets, remote installations,
number of operators, telecom providers
involved.
• Data recording and storage.
• Nature of services and contents.
• Telecom providers and ISps network
architectures.

• Time-saving activity management, to
optimize costs and operators efforts.
• security optimization thanks to integrated
access and users' permissions policy
management. MCA Player is fully integrated
with Microsoft Wind
Wind"
"ws Server's Active
Directory for user and groups creation and
management.
• MCP Servers can log users access,
activities, configurations, ordinary and
unexpected events. etc.
COMPLIANCY
MCP System is developed according to
most used international handover interface
standards.
AREA engineers participate as member
of technical boards in these international
committees allowing our R&D department
to give an important contribution to various
standards layout and development.
RELIABILITY
To grant integrity of recordings, all contents
are digitally signed by MCP Server using
SHA-1 authentication algorithm. MCR System
is installed with a redundant architecture, to
grant maximum security in data storage and
maintenance.
Moreover, thanks to its event-management
function, MCP system can be configured
to notify users by e-mail or SMS about new
incoming system events and alarms.
MAIN FEATURES

INTEGRATION
MCP system has evolved thanks to
expertise acquired over more than
a decade, on several national and
international projects.
Integration of all activity types (voice, fax.
s ! s , MMS, videocalls, 'P streams, live
audio streams, positioning) on a single
platform offers many advantages, among
which:
• Scalable architecture on storage. services
and maintenance costs.
• Short training sessions.

MCR system most important features are:

Listening capability
Listening to recorded telephonic or VoIP calls
can be done through an advanced audio
playback interface enabling, on top of normal
play-stop-rewind
functions like:
• Cyclic listening on selected audio portions.
• Graphical analysis of audio levels.
• Advanced and customizable software
equalizer.
• Professional noise reduction system.

Centralized interface
Regardless the different types of data that
are being intercepted, with NCR system LEA
operators can rapidly access to all acquired
contents (voice and lp data), using a universal
interface that allows to correlate information
coming from different media, but belonging
to the same target, or to cross information
generated by different targets.

Remote access
For LEA operators that are deployed on the
field and cannot follow real-time recording of
events, !"# system has an alerting function,
that warns operators of incoming events and
recording by s$s.
Using a normal telephone to compose a
classified number, operators can access to
an interactive voice menu that guides users
through various functions such as search,
selection and listening, even real-time, of
recorded audio or VoIP contents.

Data management
MCR system creates automatically a database
containing, for each target, information such
as phone number or internet ID, call or ‚P
stream date and time, call duration and IRI
(Interception Related Information), where
available. LEA operators can also integrate
these data with additional information, such
as. relevance of the interception, subject of
the interception, localization information, etc.
On top of the common functions "insert &
search", LEA operators can also manage full
transcription of the communication contents
throughout the call.
MCA Player embeds many Microsoft Word
functions and allows LEA operators to export
data on general models.
It is also possible to automatically or manually
export data to other systems.
Thanks to the integration with MCR
Studio, AREA's tool developed for targets
relationships analysis, LEA operators can
analyze in real time any intercepted traffic.
No manual import operation is needed
by !"# server and the operators are
immediately receiving up-to-date information
from the Communication Contents database.

Automatic 'RI Communication Content association
'RI may be sent on different media (ISDN
lines, e
Provider; MCR system manages all those
media types and correlates IRIs with their
respective Communication Contents with no
interaction from LEA operators, making the
process totally automatic, according to % & I
standards.
This mechanism allows operators to access
rapidly to complete information for every
recorded data set.

Multilevel data analysis
Access and visualization to recorded
contents are rapid and easy, regardless the
technology they have been acquired from:
a complete and unified browsing interface
allows operators to visualize e
pages, FTP transfers, chat and voice calls.
The interface can be also customized
by user type (according to their MDR
privileges).
!"# Player offers the possibility to have
multiple visualization levels, from basic
content view, that shows data as they are,
to the advanced content view, that allows
expert users to locate particular portions
of captured traffic or analyze unknown
protocols.
Furthermore, !"# Player can represent
ASCII-based protocols (such as IRC, SMTP,
#'P(, HTTP), as plain text files.

Phonebook
Phone numbers and internet IDs of targets
are all stored in a phonebook that is
customizable by LEA operators with notes
and comments.
A phonebook can either be assigned to a
single target, to contain all his contacts, or
to a whole service, which can comprehend
multiple targets. Different phonebooks
belonging to active targets can also be
visualized together.
!"# Player allows the analysis of
relationships among targets by the display
of calls or 'P data transfer direction and
frequency.

Cartography view and !" -CPS localization
LEA operators have access, through !"#
Player, to the cartographic (both historical
and live) view of the target position, whenever
location data are present into 1R1 messages.
It is also possible to follow the movement
of multiple targets at the same time
(recognized by their colors) and display
on the map(s) additional information about
the targets (such as monitored number,
timestamp of the event, etc).
The 'historical view" allows setting a
Particular time interval in which the operator
wants to display the target's positions history.
live audio interception support
!"# system can support all kinds of
recording (analog tine, low frequency,
I5DN line, etc) for fixed or vehicular tactical
interceptions.
Furthermore, MCP Player integrates the
management of MCP Tracer, a tool developed
and built by AREA for GSM/0PSlocalization of
vehicles and vehicular live audio interception.
Through DIME signaling, MCP Player can
also manage and poll third-party peripherals,
including features as threshold levels (vox) for
automatic start/stop of audio recording on the
remote tactical devices.
Configuration and management
MCP system has a user-friendly management
console that allows LEA operators to easily
modify operational parameters, even with a
remote confectiOn, software installation is
simple and immediate, ready to be deployed
on different hardware infrastructures.
