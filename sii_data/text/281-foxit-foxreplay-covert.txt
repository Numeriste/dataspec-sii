Covert

In order to benefit from IP-based intercepts, a
necessary condition is the ability to gain access
to the relevant data. Various agencies and
organizations will have different existing ways
to intercept & transport suspect’s traffic. This
document outlines how FoxReplayCovert can
facilitate a stand-alone Interception capability.
Such a capability can provide a vital supporting
role in mission-related activities, in unfriendly
or even hostile environments.
This document outlines the specifics of how
FoxReplay can help an organization benefit
from IP intercepts generated in the field.
