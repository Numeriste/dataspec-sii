AKOR-3
Automated radio emission source and
bug detection system





System features:
Checking and monitoring of premises, electric wired networks, telephone
lines and office equipment for presence of eavesdropping devices, video
cameras and infrared transmitters;
Detection of information leakage by means of radio transmission (radio
broadcast, GSM, UMTS, CDMA, DECT, NMT cellular phones, Bluetooth, WiFi, WiMAX and other communications standards).
