RMK 122, RMK 128 Universal module
Compact audio transmitters
Overview:
RMK 122 and 128 differing in output power value are universal
base modules for covert radio-transmission systems.
The products designed in small metal cases are equipped either
with a connector or leading-out wires for external power supply,
remote microphone and flexible external antenna.
Output power of the products provides optimal balance between
the range and the time of continuous operation.
Signal reception is available with the use of SET-1 special
receivers or any scanning receiver with WFM mode.
Application of SET-1 KDK 003 RC Receiver turns the transmitter into a complete RC transmission
system (including SET-1 DPK 003 RC transmitter).
