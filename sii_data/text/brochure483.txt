DEFENDING WORLD SECURITY

ADVANCED CYBER SECURITY
AND IT INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION

Secure data handling and computer defence

Communications technology and
the lnternet have evolved rapidly
in the recent past and continue
to break new ground with the
development of cloud computing.
Such developments make the world
ever more connected, with sensitive
data circulating on a publicly used,
ubiquitous network. This connectivity
opens up many opportunities for
cyber criminals, terrorists and hostile
states.
Cyber attacks have increased
significantly during the last few
years, leading to serious damage
worldwide and making existing
information and communication
systems potentially vulnerable.
Against this backdrop, all countries
and organisations managing
sensitive network data have to
develop strong cyber defence
capabilities based on advanced
technologies, processes and training.

To meet the growing cyber security
needs of users of critical IT
infrastructure, including governments
and global companies, EADS has
established a Cyber Security Customer
Solutions Centre with dedicated teams
in France, Germany and the UK.

Cassidian has a long track record in
providing the most sensitive secure IT
and data handling solutions to defence
and security customers throughout
France, Germany, the UK and other
NATO countries.
