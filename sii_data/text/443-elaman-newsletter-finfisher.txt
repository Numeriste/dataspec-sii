IT Intrusion:
Elaman's new
Finfisher Products
Elaman has started i t s own
41 development f o r I T - Intrusion
(Hacking) products and training as
we think this area will become more
and more important and effective and
is a very valuable add on to the classical IP-Monitoring systems provided
by e.g. Siemens, ATIS, ETI, etc.

Maybe authorities are already working internally on such methods but
even in this case FinFisher will widen
such an approach and specially the
training will improve the capabilities
of the staff and users.
The philosophy behind the FinFisher
IT Intrusion package is to provide the
government end-user with today's advanced hacking tools and techniques.
This enables Intelligence Agencies to
use such hacking components to ob-

tamn Intelligence information that cannot be obtained in any other way.
The Intrusion tools can be used by
Government Departments for internal
introduction I training to the hacking
threats being faced today.
Features
• Information Gathering
• Sniffing
• Exploitation

This range o f n e w IT-Intrusion products we named FinFisher.
The FinFisher kit includes certain types of Hardware products like USB
sticks to extract from a PC all passwords, Logins, E-Mails, files, etc.,
Trojan horse to control remotely a
target PC, software and methods to
get the Trojan on a target PC, WLAN
and Bluetooth hacking as well as also different kind of Training courses.
These kind of methods and applications allow to widen the capabilities in
the field of IP-Monitoring in addition
to an existing classical IP-Monitoring
system where it is limited to plain not
encrypted IP-communications. As the
FinFisher products are directly placed
on the target PCs, encryption is not
an issue anymore and also identifying

on the understanding
that there i s a need for
"authorized" Agencies to obtain information, using such methods, as
they need to be pro-active against the
strategies and tactics employed by
their Targets. They can then alert the
appropriate Law Enforcement or Military units and organizations within
their country to intercept and prevent
an incident, as opposed to reacting
after. The System has also been developed with operational simplicity in
mind, so that Intelligence operators
require the minimum of technical ability and skill when using the tactical

Appropriate Note
The FinFisher System has been developed to assist Intelligence Agencies
obtaining information from civilian individuals and groups.
It is not intended, or has it been tested, to see if it has the capability to
break into advanced complex government o r military security systems
with secret, or above security, classification.
Also, while every effort has been made to ensure the FinFisher Project can
get past known Anti-Virus and AntiSpyware Products and local Firewalls
and Security, no guarantees are given
in this area as these products are continuously being developed on a daily
basis.
