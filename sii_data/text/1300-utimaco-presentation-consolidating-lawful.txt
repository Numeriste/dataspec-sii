Introduction
Motivation for Consolidation
Lawful Interception is a legal requirement on telecom operators
LI systems manage LI requests from LEA
LI systems for different networks
• LI systems for different services

Network extensions by acquisition integration of smaller
carriers and service providers
Heterogeneous networks covering multiple services
Different platforms from multiple vendors
LI platform per service

A Case Study
Key business imperatives (1/2)
Consolidate LI system
Four distinct LI systems to be integrated
Legacy system to be replaced

No Risk
Work on the LI system should not lead to any disruption in the LI service

• Improve efficiency
Workflows to be optimized
LI system for all services to be operated from different locations
Response times to be met in all cases

A Case Study
Key business imperatives (2/2)
Reduce OPEX
IA Operational costs were to be reduced by at least 30%

• ROI in eighteen month
All investments to be compensated by cost savings (staff, power) within
18 months

Technical Requirements
How they have been defined
Consulting company of the customer prepared an evaluation report.
Result: Utimaco was asked to consolidate the system fulfill
requirements
Replacement of the LI system for the fixed network and the legacy system
Integration of the LI system for the mobile network
Service 50.000 active targets up to 17.000 concurrent intercepts
Support at least 4 Gbps throughput; 500 Mbps single line throughput
Max. response time of one second on 80% of all user inputs

Additional Requirements
• 100% system availability. No single point of failure permissible.
Full migration of all target data to the new system.
• Zero data loss during the migration.

Detailed documentation of all products and services.
• Technical training for administrators and operators.
24x7 technical support.
Completion of the project within one year. Old system will be
switched off at a fixed date. No more maintenance on the old
system.

Challenges and Obstacles (1/2)
How to overcome
26 different network elements from 11 vendors.
Switch vendors are: Alcatel, Cisco, Ericsson, Huawei, Juniper, NokiaSiemens and others.
3000 network elements to be provisioned

Know-how on the legacy system was dispersed among many
people from different departments.
Technical specifications of network interfaces were incomplete

Challenges and Obstacles (2/2)
How to overcome
• Some network elements required outdated technologies.
• Tight schedule. Fixed date to switch of the old solutions.
Required smooth migration of thousands of targets within a few
hours.

Project Phase 1

utimacci

• System to be deployed in two phases
Phase 1: all network elements already supported by Utimaco
LIMS
These nodes handle the majority of subscribers (fixed voice
and fixed broadband)
By that 80% of the intercepts migrated to the new system with
phase 1

Project Phase 2
Remaining NEs network parts and services.
NEs that needed to be developed.
Implementation went smoothly as the main system was already
up and running.
Phase 2 changes are SW updates on the SW level
implemented with phase 1.

Lessons Learned (1/2)
What can go wrong what can be improved?
Consolidation can be a complex challenge because
Replacing legacy systems disperse knowledge and specifications of
NEs.
Large networks, location wise, number of NEs and services offered by
the operator.
Risks of service outages on the LI system while migration.

Lessons Learned (2/2)
What can go wrong what can be improved?
Consolidation is manageable by
Meticulous requirement analysis
Solid system design
Detailed project planning and regular follow up
Consequent project management including status reports the board
High attention on possible test scenarios while migration

Result is still worth it, because of significant
savings and ROI within eighteen months!
