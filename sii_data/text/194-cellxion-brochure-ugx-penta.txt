Contains two fully functional commercial grade
GSM (900/1800MHz or 850/1900,200mW)
BTS transceivers and any combination of three
UMTS (900 / 2100MHz 32mWav) Node B
transceivers with excellent RF performance in
high multi-path environments.
The transceivers are independently
configurable for all network parameters, and
can transmit between 0.1 mW and maximum
power in 2dB steps.

Built-in 'environment monitor' to assess the
number of networks in an area, their respective
configurations, and provide information
to optimize user configuration of the BTS
transceiver modules.
M Comprehensive identification of IMSI, IMEl
and TMSl information with dynamic control
capability including comprehensive denial
of service.
D Simultaneous high speed acquisition of
handsets (up to 1200 per minute), across up
to five networks.

M The optional 'In Network Calling' allows calls to
be made within the UGX system (GSM only).
D cellxion 'Feels Like' function uses BCCH
manipulation to give a virtual power effect of
up to several hundred watts.
W Comprehensive mySQL database featuring
handsets cross-referenced against IMEI, and
networks against PLMN.

B The unique cellxion software client and GUI
(graphical user interface) is consistent across
the entire range of cellxion GX & UGX cellular
intercept products.
Optional UGX PENTA Power Amplifier for
vehicle fitting t o provides increased power
capability up t o 20W per GSM transceiver
channel and 3.2W CPlCH for UMTS channels.
D Optional Covert Call (TK) software application
to provide a covert call capability to lock a
target handset for direction finding using the
cellxion MSL or other suitable DF systems.

B Optional Measurement Reports (MR) software
application to provide handset geo-location
and a mapping interface using timing advance,
RxLev & RxQal measurement.
