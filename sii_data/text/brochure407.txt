Introduction
The Ei-Series is a turnkey Enterrnpt solution
in an appliance platform. Uffering the most
flexibte approach to network surveillance
and novel approaches to rapid deployment
and stealthy reporting of captured data.
the 5-Series devices are unmatched in the
industry.

An attractive feature of the fi-Seriesis
its ability to passive& discover network
topiogy--this allowz an individual to
depIoy it wlth no prior knwvledge of the
target network. The device can be placed
in-tine and immediately act as a passive
bridge while performing its mission.
As intelligenceis being gathered and
the device has an understandingof the
network. it uses its stealth reparting
techniques to return captured information
or accomplirh a variety of other missions.
