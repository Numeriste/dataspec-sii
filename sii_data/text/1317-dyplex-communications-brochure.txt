DROID-OPK allows the user to covertly listen and track
a paired UC Android device. The UC Android device is
paired with a Monitoring device which has the ability
to activate the microphone via OpenMic at any time.
The Audio transfer is done via cellular data, therefore
providing excellent audio quality when compared to
other cellular solutions.

The DROID-OPK allows for GPS tracking of the target
device while the audio is being transferred. This
allows for quick and easy locating of a UC device
without losing audio contact.

The Monitor Device user interface has been streamlined for ease of use. You will never have to wade
through complicated sets of menus and characters
again.
Every effort has been made to make the UC device as
covert as possible. The paired DROID-OPK devices
communicate via Session Initiated Protocol (SIP) via
cellular data. When OpenMic is active there is no
indication on the UC device at all. The user may continue to use the device as they regularly would, including normal phone calls.
