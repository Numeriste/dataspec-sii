Beowulf I1
Stand Alone, Solid State

The most important thing we build is trust

BeowuwII
The Beowulf I1 is a stand alone recordingdevice.
The very small and lightweight recorder intercept all
ambient audio making it extremely suitable for close
proximity operations.
The hassle free design, with the battery and microphone
wires preconfigured and small size, make the recorder
easy to conceal in any environment. The recorder is
operated easily using only a single button or the external
wired slide switch. Additional recordingoptions include
multiple scheduled recordings or voice activation (VOX).
Positive feedback from 2 LEDs, provide assurance on the
device's operational state.
The audio is stored, as MicrosoftB wave audio files, on
the internal 16 GB flash drive using the FAT32 file system.
Evidence verification is included with the bundled
Wavechecker I1 Utility which detects whether or not
audio files recorded with the Beowulf family of products
have been modified after the audio was recorded.

The Beowulf I1 also includes an auto-sensing function. When
connected to a standard US6 port on a MicrosoftB Windows
compatible PC, the Beowulf Board will appear in one of two setups (depending on settings): "Show drive" (Read only) or "Drive
is hidden" (Covert secure mode).
