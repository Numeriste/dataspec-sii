Usage Example 1: Covert Operation

Usage Example 2: Technical Surveillance Unit

A source in an Organized Crime Group (OCG) was
given a FinUSB Dongle that secretly extracted Account
Credentials of Web and Email accounts and Microsoft
Office documents from the Target Systems, while the
OCG used the USB device to exchange regular files like
Music, Video and Office Documents.

A Technical Surveillance Unit (TSU) was following a Target
that frequently visited random Internet Cafés making
monitoring with Trojan-Horse-like technology impossible.
The FinUSB was used to extract the data left on the public
Terminals used by the Target after the Target left.

After returning the USB device to Headquarters the
gathered data could be decrypted, analyzed and used to
constantly monitor the group remotely.

Several documents that the Target opened in his web-mail
could be recovered this way. The gathered information
included crucial Office files, Browsing History through
Cookie analysis, and more.

loss or save essential time during an operation. In most
cases, the Target System is protected with a passwordenabled Screensaver or the target user is not logged in
and the Login Screen is active.
FinFireWire enables the Operator to quickly and covertly
bypass the password-protected screen and access the
Target System without leaving a trace or harming essential
forensic evidence.

Usage Example 1: Forensic Operation

Usage Example 2: Password Recovery

A Forensic Unit entered the apartment of a Target and
tried to access the computer system. The computer was
switched on but the screen was locked.
As they were not allowed, for legal reasons, to use a Remote
Monitoring Solution, they would have lost all data by switching off the system as the hard-disk was fully encrypted.
FinFireWire was used to unlock the running Target
System enabling the Agent to copy all files before
switching the computer off and taking it back to Headquarters.

Combining the product with traditional Forensic
applications like Encase®, Forensic units used the
RAM dump functionality to make a snapshot of the
current RAM information and recovered the Hard-Disk
encryption passphrase for TrueCrypt’s full disk encryption.

The Update License controls whether FinSpy is able to retrieve new updates from the Gamma Update server. It is
combined with the FinFisherTM After Sales Support module.After expiry, the FinSpy system will still be fully functional but no longer able to retrieve the newest versions
and bug-fixes from the FinSpy Update server.

The Target License controls how many FinSpy Targets can
be active in parallel.

B. Agent License
The Agent License controls how many FinSpy Agents can
login to the FinSpy Master in parallel.
Example:
· 5 Agent Licenses are purchased.
· FinSpy Agent licenses can be installed on an unlimited number of systems, however
· Only 5 FinSpy Agent systems can login to the FinSpy
Master and work with the data at the same time

Screenshot active Target with License

Screenshot inactive Target without License

Active refers to activated FinSpy Target installations no
matter whether the Target System is online or offline.
When FinSpy Target is deployed on a Target System and
no Target Licenses are available, the FinSpy Target gets
temporary deactivated and no recording and live access will
be possible. As soon as a new License is available (e.g. by
upgrading the existing License or de-infecting one of the
active FinSpy Targets), the Target will be assigned the free
license and it will be activated and begin recording and providing live access.

FinFly ISP appliances are based on carrier grade server
technology, providing the maximum reliability and
scalability to meet almost every challenge related to
network topologies. A wide-range of Network Interfaces –
all secured with bypass functions – are available for the
required active network connectivity.
Several passive and active methods of Target Identification –
from online monitoring via passive tapping to interactive
communications between FinFly ISP and the AAA-Servers
– ensure that the Targets are identified and their appropriate
traffic is provided for the infection process.
FinFly ISP is able to infect Files that are downloaded by
the Target on-the-fly or infect the Target by sending
fake Software Updates for popular Software. The new
release now integrates Gamma’s powerful remote infection application FinFly Web to infect Targets on-the-fly by

Different Location Possibilities
· FinFly ISP can be used as a tactical or
strategic solution within ISP networks

A tactical solution is mobile and the hardware is dedicated
to the infection tasks inside the access network close to the
targets’ access points. It can be deployed on a short-term
basis to meet tactical requirements focused on either a specific target or a small number of targets in an area.

A strategic solution would be a permanent ISP/countrywide
installation of FinFly ISP to select and infect any target from
the remote headquarters without the need for the LEA to
be on location.
Of course, it is possible to combine tactical and strategic
solutions to reach a maximum of flexibility for the infection
operations.

The FinLifelineSupport provides professional back-office
support for trouble resolution and technical queries. It also
provides back-office support remotely, for FinFisherTM SW
bug fixes and Hardware replacements under warranty. Furthermore, with FinLifelineSupport the client automatically
receives new features and functionalities with the standard
release of bug fixes.
Bug Fixes
FinSupport is a product driven support organization whereby a highly skilled after-sales support manager receives related queries by email or telephone. The after sales support
manager is based in Germany and his hours of operation
are 09:00 – 17:00 Central European Time (CET).
With the FinLifelineSupport, support is available from
09:00–17:00 CET. If a request for support is logged outside
of standard office hours it will be addressed immediately on
the next working day.
When the customer reports an incident, we log an Incident
Report (IR) and document the priority of the incident. Within a specified period, corrective actions will follow based
on the assigned priority. The FinFisherTM team then has the
responsibility of coordinating the investigation and resolution of the IR, as well as communicating the status and new
information to the IR originator.
For high priority issues, we ensure that the system continues
to work smoothly by quickly delivering workaround solutions and tested bug fixes. When the FinFisherTM team delivers a workaround, in parallel it also escalates the Problem
Report (PR) to the Research and Development (R&D) department to ensure a quick resolution. These professional support measures ensure that the software meets the highest
expectations.

Definitions of query and fault priority
FinLifelineSupport processes the incoming queries and problem reports according to their urgency. Two factors rate the urgency
of an incident, and both are included in each IR:
· ‘Priority’ based solely on the technical scope of the error
· ‘Customer Severity’ is a more objective factor and based on the resultant customer impact

The following ‘Priority’ table provides an overview of the corresponding technical scope:

Priority

Definition

Example

1

critical issue: crucial aspect of system not The Proxy is down and no communication to the FinSpy
working
Target can be established.

2

major issue with no workaround

An Antivirus update detects an already installed RMS which
requires an immediate update in order to stay operational
within the infected system.

3

major issue with workaround

FinSpy Target functionality doesn’t operate properly but can
be fixed with a workaround solution.

4

minor issue with little impact on system

Response Times
In 90 percent of all incidents, we will keep our response
times as depicted in the table below.
‘Working day(s)’ = as defined in the German calendar, and
thus, excludes holidays observed in Germany.
There are three phases in our response times:
· Initial Response
· Corrective Action Feedback
· Problem Resolution (or Priority De-Escalation)

The time for the ‘Initial Response’ is from the moment we
log an incident to the actual confirmation response sent to
the customer acknowledging receipt of the incident.
The ‘Initial Response’ may also ask for more detailed information or, in less complex cases, may immediately solve the
problem.
