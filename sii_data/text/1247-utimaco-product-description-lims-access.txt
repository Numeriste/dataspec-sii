Utimaco provides three types of probes:
LIMS Access Points for IP services

Cost-effective probes for single IP services like e-mail ,
VoIP, AAA, SMS, MMS

LIMS Access Points DPI

Deep Packet Inspection Probes for 1Gb to 1OGb
Ethernet networks

LIMS Access Points TOM

Probes for circuit-switched networks based on E1/T1 ,
SDH/SONET (STM-1 to STM-4)

LIMS Access Points are centrally controlled by the Utimaco
LIMS and Utimaco DRS . All data intercepted by the probes
are encrypted and protected from unauthorized access .
Before data is handed over to law enforcement agencies it is
mediated to comply with international LI standards.

Deep Packet Inspection
Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) is the name of a state-of-theart technology designed to meet some of the key challenges

Supported services and protocols

relating to the plethora of IP-based communication services .
The ever-growing number of Internet applications and
IP-based protocols make it hard for law enforcement agencies (LEAs) and communication service providers to identify
'bad guys' or criminals on the net and to analyze their communications for the purpose of criminal investigations and
prevention of terrorism .
Utimaco LIMSAccess Points implement DPI technology not
only to filter individual IP packets but also to decode and
analyze complete communications flows of more than
300 different Internet applications. The probes can either
extract only the metadata (e.g . source ID, destination ID, IP
