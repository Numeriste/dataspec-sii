Positioning control system
GPSInnOva is a professional device for geographic real
time monitoring of moving targets.
It is an integrated tracking system that includes
numerous tools lot:
•real time targets monitoring
• data display, research and analysis
•data storage and display on any kind of devices.

GP$Innovo, a complete tracking system developed by
R&D Innova Laboratories, consists of a miniature
satellite tracking device and a monitoring system with

integrated hands-on software for device se' up and
рюgгоmmiпg. tracking visualization, data analysis
(geographical, temporal and textual).
Targets con be monitored both from о centralized or a
portable monitoring system.
The small size of the device and the enclosed magnet

enables on easy and immediate installation on the
targeted vehicle, while the battery package ovoids
frequent replacements.
