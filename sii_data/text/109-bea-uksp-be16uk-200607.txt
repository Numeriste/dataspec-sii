UKSP protocol configuration on BE16UK
BE16UK remote units are all able to work with both protocol standards BEA or UKSP.
The Protocol set by default in all remote units is the BEA one.
Actually the remote unit is not able to switch authomatically from one protocol to the other.
To modify the protocol setting it is necessary to connect the beacon to a PC by a serial cable.
To interact with the beacon: in the PC must be installed a software emulating the terminal
HYPER TERMINAL (native with Win95/98/ME/NT/2000), CRT (www.vandyke.com)…
Open the terminal session with following parameters:
( serial protocol)
Baud Rate
Data Bits
Parity
Stop Bits
Flow control

38400
8
None
1
RTS/CTS ( Xon / Xoff)
