Biometric Speaker Spotting System ( B S ~ )
Engine designed f o r integration in large-scale systems
- such as intelligence a n d strategic interception systems -

spot, filter a n d classify
large amounts of incoming audio files
to

I
(landline, cellular, VOIP)

B S -~Feature rich capabilities:

Bs3 Functions:

Speaker Identification
The system compares incoming audio files (up t o t w o
speakers within a mono or a stereo channel) with one or
various potential targets (N t o M identification).
Spotted audios are returned with associated target
matching scores (Likelihood Ratios - LR), which are
compared with defined threshold levels that trigger alarms
in related strategic interception and intelligence systems.
Gender Identification
The system identifies the gender (male/female) of the
speakerls o f the recording, allowing the system t o focus on
a specific gender.
Language ldentification
The system performs the comparison of incoming
audio files with the pre-loaded language models (open set
identification),
adding operative
value
to
live
communication monitoring by directing calls t o the
appropriate live listener.
BS3 uses AGNITlO's proprietary and pioneering voice
biometrics technology (text independent, channel
independent and language independent) based on unique
information extracted from an individual's vocal tract, thus
obtaining a high level o f accuracy and reliability.

Bs3 Use cases:
3 Frontal analysis and processing (effective

prioritization):
Speaker spotting o f key targets inside a
continuous flow of telephone conversations (landline,
cellular, VOIP) in near-real time

â€¢ Storage 'Digint' (traceability):
Datamining for large storage repositories t o t a g o r
