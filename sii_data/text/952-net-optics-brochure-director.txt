Net Optics Director is a “Smart Filtering”
appliance that directs traffic of interest to
monitoring tools. Monitor as many as 26
SPAN ports or 13 in-line links with up to
11 monitoring tools.
TapFlowTM filtering
technology enables you
to select traffic of interest
for each tool based on
protocols, IP addesses,
ports, and VLANs.

Director provides access capabilities
you need to leverage your monitoring
tools across your entire network while
streamlining the amount of data the tools
need to process. It is a versatile component
of a monitoring access platform (MAP) for
improved network visibility and security
threat management across the entire
network.

Efficient Monitoring Access
Today’s networks are delivering more
services and carrying greater amounts of
multi-protocol traffic at higher data rates.
A single set of wires now carries data,
voice, and streaming video simultaneously.
Increased security threats and tighter
regulatory compliance requirements further
complicate network operations.

tools to be deployed across a large number

of network links, with remote, centralized
control of exactly which traffic is directed to
each tool. Using browser-based or platformbased software with friendly graphical user
interfaces, tools are easily and instantly moved
from one link or set of links to another without
unplugging and plugging cables and physically moving devices. There is no need to wait
for a maintenance window or get approvals for
changing the network configuration, because
once Director is in place, it is completely
transparent to the network. Even if power is
removed from both of the unit’s redundant
power supplies, the fully passive design
ensures that in-line network links remain open
and network traffic keeps flowing.

Indigo™ Management Software
Net Optics provides a versatile console
for managing and monitoring any number
of Director and other Net Optics devices.
Its easy-to-use, Windows‑based graphical
user interface (System Manager) makes
configuring and monitoring Director simple,
and password protection ensures security.

Maintaining network security and
performance in this environment means
monitoring more points in the network, for
more detailed information, and for different
types of data. As a result, monitoring tools
are oversubscribed and multiple groups with
various responsibilities compete for use of
the tools and access points.
Director answers the need for more efficient
monitoring access by enabling a pool of
