N B b o t - &rP Edition Foundation Module connects i25 leading analytical tool, Analyds Notebook, with Em's
integrating link temporal and geospatial analysis to provide you with an unparalleled analysis solution.

By enabling direct access t o Esrif ArcGlS Server from
within Analyst's Notebook, the Analyst's Notebook GrP Edition Foundation Module empowers analytical
processes while maximising an organisation's existing
investment in analytical and geospatial toolsets.This
module provides a live i2 and Esri connection which
integrates a broad range of analytical capabilities with
standard and advanced Esri functionality, in one
centralised work environment.
From within the Analyst's Notebook environment, users
will select a preferred server base map, discover and
develop dynamic layers, run geospatial querying and
more.The Analyst's Notebook - GrP Edition Foundation
Module empowers analysts t o easily identify and focus in
on relevant information by providing the technology
t o view i2 charts as dynamic Esri map layers and
