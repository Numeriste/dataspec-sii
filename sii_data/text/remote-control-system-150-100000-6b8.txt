Remote Control Systems - 150

Digital Remote Control for APSS-Systems – RC-APSS
General
The RC-APSS consists of the miniature slip-on remote control receiver RCRX-APSS (Model No.: 150
100 0007) and the hand-held remote control transmitter RCTX-UNI (Model No.:150 100 0008). It
guarantees the coded transmission of remote control instructions through a separate transmission
protocol with error protection to exclude malfunctions through customary remote control systems.
Because of the 16-bit coding, the RC-APSS has more than 65.000 codes which can be adjusted with
the aid of the transmitter.
The remote control receiver can be operated in two different modes:
• permanent listening watch
• Stand-by (the receiver switches every 10 seconds to listening watch for 100 ms.)
The receiver is made as slip-on module for audio transmitters of the digital personal protection
systems APSS 2000-k and APSS 4000-k (Model-No.: 120 200 0001 or 120 200 0008) respectively
and realizes the switching on/off of these transmitters. The external wiring remains guaranteed.
