MODEL 7506

The RF Near Field Component
The TSE 7506 was developed for counter electronic surveillance. Its primary requirement was to be able to covertly detect clandestine Radio Microphones that could effectively be used by both non-experienced and experienced counter measure personnel. Its performance therefore had to be independent of the local RF environment, a
domain where many previous instruments failed.
The result is TSE 7506, which is a differential broadband “H” field detection system,
has the following specifications:
Technical
Frequency Range
Detection capabilities
Audible Warning

25 MHz - 4 GHz and beyond
All types of Radio Microphone including “Smart”
