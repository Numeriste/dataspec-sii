EKMS 1700 - ELKAT GSM (5.2) - East
The ELKAT – G is a Passive Monitoring System for GSM phone voice, data and fax
transmissions.
It allows the interception of GSM cellular calls by capturing off air radio transmission signal
from the uplink and the downlink channels.
It is sophisticated and gives the operator the ability to listen to desired cellular phone
conversations, as well as see SMS sent by other cellular phones.
It can also decode FAX signals due to its passive modes of operation, it can’t be detected by
the cellular phone operator neither by the cellular phone target.
The system can handle from 2 channels on a unit up to 48 per unit and more in the whole
system.
Supported by a 12V input, gives the ELKAT – G the option to be recharged in a private car or
with a small rechargeable battery.
