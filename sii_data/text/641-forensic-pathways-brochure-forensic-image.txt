Millions of Images to handle?
Which Mobile Phone or Camera created which Digital Image?
Forensic Image Analyser uses 'Sensor Pattern Noise' (SPN) to identify the
originating device for a set of images. SNP is a unique identifier created by natural
imperfections in the silicone chip, and different sensitivity of pixels to light, that
allows identification of a specific digital device. The uniqueness of the
imperfections makes SPN a robust fingerprint even allowing differentiation
between devices of the sa me model.
Whether a camera, mobile phone or scanner, FIA can detect if images were taken
by a suspect device and is compatible with ail the world's digital cameras and
mobile phones including smartphones. ln addition, FIA can also process images
captured by new ta blet technology.
