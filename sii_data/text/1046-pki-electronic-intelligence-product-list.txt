of our counter-measures specialists. It is a
portable counter-surveillance system for analysis
of radio frequency surveillance. As an
intermediate field counter measure it can monitor
several rooms at the same time. It is easily
programmable, with results stored for
repeatability and future appraisal, with a full A 4
report printout of text and graphical display in
line or bar. It allows a novice user with a modest
background in radio scanning to be operational
in 30 minutes and to produce a fully documented
predetermined scan. PKI 4100 is not to be
confused as near field, one room at a time,
equipment. It provides rapid spectrum analysis,
with additional spectrum analyser functions. It
can readily identify clandestine transmissions
including SMART spread spectrum devices, and
display video transmissions at “picture in
picture”. The complete system is fully autarkic

which are switched off, cannot be found by any
counter surveillance equipment based on radio
scanners. The solution is a debugging device
independent from any emission of radio
frequencies. Even before using a new room for
conferences or after installations, respectively
maintenance operations in the room, a basic
sweep is absolutely necessary to avoid
monitoring by planted devices. PKI 4200 does
not only detect active bug devices but also those
which have been switched off. The extremely
lightweight unit (only 1.8 kg) is a Third Harmonic
Junction Detector and important facility for
discriminating between false and real targets.

PKI 4400

Portable Noise Generator
The PKI 4400 is designed as an easily portable
acoustic noise-generating unit, which can be
carried in coat-pockets or briefcases, in order to
protect sensitive conversations inside rooms.
The PKI 4400 Portable Noise Generator is very
versatile, as it can be fixed on many different
surfaces inside the room in order to protect
sensitive conversations from being monitored.
The typical application is found in conference
rooms with critical areas like windows and non
controllable adjacent rooms. It is suitable for
walls, floors, ceilings, water- and/or heating
pipes and windows. By means of the supplied 4
resonators, the unit creates a noise which, by its
vibrations, disturbs every common microphone
by overlapping the sound-waves of spoken
words. The optimised voiceband noise masking
reduces the effectiveness of eavesdropping
devices such as contact microphones, wired
microphones inside walls, battery operated audio
transmitters or devices using mains power

supplies for operation as well as laser-/
microwave- and/or infrared reflections from
windows. Any environmental masking easily is
possible by using several units of the PKI 4400 at
the same location. The PKI 4400 can be mounted
to any smooth surface by the use of the provided
suction cups or just placed in any critical area.

PKI 4650

PKI 4655

Wired Noise Generator, Wireless Noise Generator
The technology of monitoring devices is rapidly
increasing and detection and location of such
devices is very hard to realize. Transmission
frequencies of such items may vary nowadays
from VHF- to upper GHzranges. Additionally
optical monitoring systems, like Lasers, Infrared
Systems and Audio-Stethoscopes are in use.
Therefore it is essential that government
departments, as well as industrial companies
protect themselves against such monitoring
devices. For this purpose we have developed our
PKI 4650 and PKI 4655. With both systems an
electronic generator creates a white and/or pink
noise which is emitted via the resonators to the
windows, doors or walls. The resonators can be
placed and fixed by the supplied special mastics
material. By means of these vibrations, such
monitoring devices are interfered and an
understandable transmission is impossible. PKI
4650, as the standard set, comes with the
generator and four cable-connected resonators.
PKI 4655 uses the same principle but is
independent from cable connections, as the
resonators are battery-operated and each unit
consists of an integrated generator and
resonator. Each unit can be placed within
seconds. Depending on room size, the number of
devices can vary from one unit only to infinity.
This white-noise generator especially is in use
where members of conferences should not be
aware of such protective actions.

object you wish to locate, not only the indicated
field strength but also the tone pitch increases.
Sound alarm of course can be switched off in
cases where sounds must be avoided, as for
example during sweeping of a room where active
transmitters might be in operation. The
sensitivity of reception is especially high within
the frequency range of mobile phones and
wireless video transmitters, i.e. between 0,9 and
5,8 GHz.

Interference attacks are no longer limited to 100
m. Eavesdropping technology has been revolutionized by GSM technology (see PKI catalogue).
The room screening system comprises HF-

screening and acoustic insulation including air
conditioning, electrical installation and furniture.
Screening is totally invisible for the user.
Furthermore, we are prepared to supply
bug-proof booths ready to use.

Architectural Room Screening
With the PKI 4750 series of room screening
devices we offer a large range of products,
architectural engineering, planning and
know-how for worldwide government agencies
and special task forces in order to prevent their
own facilities from being monitored and to make
sure that internal electronic works will be kept
inside their rooms. The PKI 4750 Architectural
Room Screening integrates the RF-screening into
the architecture of a new or already existing
room being invisible to the users and others.
Each single component, by its own, cannot
guarantee a complete protection. Only the
integration of compatible devices can realise this.
Planning, construction, production and
aftersales-service are combined in one hand by
PKI ELECTRONIC INTELLIGENCE. Only with this
complete service package attenuations of 40 or
60 dB at 10 MHz to 3 GHz can be achieved and
guaranteed. For even higher requirements we
use copper- or steel-sheets providing a damping
of 80 dB up to 10 GHz.
But as each single project needs to be evaluated

case by case it is essential to stay in close
discussion with our customers and to find out
which kind of electromagnetic screening is most
suitable.
