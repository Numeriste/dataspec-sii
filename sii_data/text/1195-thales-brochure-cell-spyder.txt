CELL SPYDER OFFERS GLOBAL SOLUTIONS
FOR THE CHALLENGES ENCOUNTERED IN

REQUIREMENTS / CELL SPYDER PROVIDES

COMMUNICATIONS MONITORING, INDEPENDENT

• Communication monitoring throughout the country
Cell Spyder network guarantees total monitoring of telephone systems.

ON TYPE AND SIZE OF THE NETWORK.
• Analogue or digital • Fixed or mobile • Radio interface, network interface (A, Abis)
• Multi-standard • Multi-network (future and existing networks) • Various sizes of network
being monitored • Multi-manufacturer interface • Automatic digital recording
• Conforms to E.T.S.I. recommendations (ES 201 671) • Signalling (R2, N4, S5, SS7,
DTMF...) • E1/T1.

• Surveillance of a subscriber:
surveillance of specific subscribers through their telephone number(s).
Cell Spyder constantly monitors every call a subscriber makes or receives. The number of target subscribers can be
parameterised.

• Communication monitoring in a specific area:
surveillance of all communications in the area being monitored, whether or not the subscribers have been identified
previously.
By monitoring every communication within one or several cells, Cell Spyder tactique makes it possible to place a specific
area under surveillance, (port, airport, prison, stadium, etc.), even if the subscribers present have not been previously identified.

• Locating service:
locate subscribers within the network (mobile).
Locating is accomplished thanks to information supplied by the network (e.g. cellular networks).

• Surveillance of a specific type of user:
roaming subscribers, special subscriptions…
Cell Spyder guarantees the surveillance of a previously defined type of user (roaming subscribers, prepaid cards, etc.).

BTS

• Surveillance of a specific type of call:

BTS

Interface

international calls, calls from or towards a specific country.
Cell Spyder has the capability to filter either all international calls or calls from or towards a specific country.

A
Interface

• Global surveillance of all the networks in a country:
allows security services to perform global surveillance, regardless of the network used.
Today's quickly changing mobile telephony must not mask other networks. Cell Spyder manages all your pre-existing
networks and offers an integrated security solution, giving to the user the ability to manage an unified monitoring centre.
Centralising surveillance thus allows processing communications that come from a variety of fixed and mobile networks
throughout the country (whether or not they were set up by THALES Communications).

According to the configuration of the telephone networks
to be monitored, Cell Spyder consists of:
• One or several interception management centres.
• Passive sensors (that cannot be detected by the subscribers):
- on a cooperating network is controlled by the Cell Spyder management centre,
- on a non-cooperating network when the network cannot "see" Cell Spyder.
• Means of routing the monitored communications from the sensors to the monitoring centre:
- via the public network,
- via secured networks (securised leased lines, private radio relays, etc.).
• One or several monitoring centres.

CUSTOMERS

OPERATION MODE

• Security services.
• COMINT agencies.
• Telecom operators, in the area
of their legal responsibilities.

• The number being monitored « blacklist » are entered
at the interception management centre.
• The numbers being monitored are then sent to all the sensors
by the interception management centre.
• The monitoring centre is notified each time an interception
is entered or removed.
• All calls are monitored.
• Every time a monitored number calls or is called, the
communication, as well as all technical information
(signalling, date and time, etc.), are retransmitted by the sensor
to the monitoring centre in real time.
• The communications received by the monitoring centre are
then recorded in real time, and then they are either:
- processed by operators in real time,
- processed at a later time,
- digitally stored for later use.
