Different scenarios for
Speaker Identification applications
Intelligence/CounterTerrorism

Criminal Investigation

•
•

•

•
•
•
•
•

Huge volume of intercepts
Various targets (sometimes
several hundred)
Different languages spoken
Emphasis on spotting targets
as calls come in
Limited accuracy usually
sufficient
Strict time constraints
Usually no need to gather
evidence

Intelligence Agencies

Limited number of
intercepted calls
Fewer targets
Spoken language generally
known in advance
Each call can be analyzed
High accuracy required
Looser time constraints
Intercepts may have to be
produced as evidence

Speaker Identification through Biometrics
¬ Every voice contains acoustic-phonetic features that can be
extracted, amplified, stored and used to build Voice Prints (VPs)
¬ VPs are based on “certified” audio recordings
¬ Like fingerprints, VPs can also be used for comparison with
elements gathered in the field
¬ Accuracy scores are intrinsically statistical (P Err > 0)
¬ In telephone intercepts, voice is the only “signature” that can be
assessed

!
Each individual can be assigned a Voice Print to
determine his/her identity

LFSI – Loquendo Free Speech Identification
• Software technology allows the identification of
speakers in natural speech telephone calls
• Phonetic GMM recognition
• Search for several targets at the same time
• Real time processing of audio files
• Provides normalized scores for every “voice print –
audio file” pairing
• Language independent
• Channel independent (mobile, fixed, VoIP)
• Excellent accuracy results (obtained at NIST ’06 SRE)

What about the accuracy?
Elements to consider:
1) A priori probability of correct target interception
2) False Alarms (False Positives)

FA

1) Should tend to zero in authentication applications
2) May be more acceptable in Intelligence applications

3) False Miss (False Negatives)

FM

1) Normally unacceptable in Intelligence
2) More acceptable in authentication applications

4) Impossibility of optimizing both error rates (FA and FM) at the
same time

Enough accuracy? An example
a) Working Point where PFA|1target = 1%
" then an average of 1 call out of 100 will be wrong
with reference to each specific target
If you look for 100 targets
PFA|100targets = 1-Pright = 1-(0,99)100 = 63%
USUALLY UNACCEPTABLE
b) Working point where PFA|1target = 0,1%
PFA|100targets = 9%
MUCH BETTER

How to improve accuracy

What’s next?
We have only considered point 4): Voice Prints comparison

1) Investigative knowledge
2) Network parameters (CLI, DN, IMEI code,…)
3) Speech content (Spoken Language, keywords,...)
4) Speaker features (VP biometrics, gender, emotion, …)
So now let’s consider point 3): Spoken Language
and 4) Gender

Language Identification (L2I)
• A model of each individual language can be made
using its characteristic features
• A likelihood score can be calculated from
comparing speech recordings to language models
• The likelihood scores indicate which language is
being spoken
• Based on sufficient speech recordings in a specific
language coming from a variety of speakers, the
language identification engine can be trained to
recognize new languages
• Also suitable for dialects (may be less precise)
• Suitable for Accent Identification (development in
progress)

15

® All Rights Reserved

Gender Identification
• A model of each gender (male/female) can be
made using general voice features
• A likelihood score can be calculated from
comparing speech recordings to gender models
• Suitable for filtering calls (men are often targets)

Example of combinations of different filters (1/2)
Investigative assumptions
Example involves an Italo-American company
One branch in the US, one in Italy
Drug-trafficking involved
Bad guys are Italian (could be located in Italy and USA)
1000 calls a day on that link
50% involve women

Voice Print library knowledge/assumptions
100 targets related to drug trafficking:
10 women
90 men, of which
30 Americans
60 Italians

17

® All Rights Reserved

Example of combinations of different filters (2/2)
Technology assumptions
FA Gender Id # FA Speaker Id # FA Language Id
Then the comparison will be made between:
60 VPs belonging to Italian men involved in drug trafficking
The percentage of the 1000 calls/day where only men are present

The system will first perform a comparison to check gender
and then if only men are involved in the call
it will perform the Italian male VPs comparison
Therefore:
60 VPs instead of 100 $ FAtotal = 5,8% (instead of 9%)
Applied to 500 calls instead of 1000 per day
Without any classification there would be an average of 90 FA/day
WITH THE FILTERS $ 29 FA/day

CONCLUSIONS
Intelligent adoption of different filtering criteria may
improve the chances of a successful search and reduce
time wasted on analysis of irrelevant material
The search for specific targets (based on Voice Print
comparison) can be enhanced if individuals are also
grouped according to the languages they speak/ their
gender
Loquendo provides solutions combining Speaker
Identification and Language Identification as well as
Gender Identification
