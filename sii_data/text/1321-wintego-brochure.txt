WlNT consists of two main components:
A dedicated, durable, all-in-one hardware box that offers extended operating ranges and connectivity in
the field.The box fits into many types of backpacks and other portable bags.
A hybrid laptop that becomes a tablet device with a touchscreen. Field agents use the laptop's intuitive
interface to control WlNT wirelessly.

With their innocent appearance, the two components are designed to enable operational teams to move around
to different locations and deploy the system rapidly and covertly, without attracting attention. The components
communicate wirelessly with each other and operate for hours on internal batteries. Agents can control the box
remotely with the laptop from anywhere. Alternatively, the box can be left to work unattended in a car or hideout.
