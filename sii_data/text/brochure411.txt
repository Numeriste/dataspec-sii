WolfhoundTM-PROCell Phone Detector is a precision, handheld, wireless sniffer specifically tuned to the RF signature of common cell
phones (both U.S. & European bands) including PCS, CDMA / WCDMA (UMTS), GSM, EGSM Cellular bands as well as GPS trackers
and even U.S. DECT 6.0 cordless phones that cause interference with European cellular carriers. Wolfhoundm-PRO'S high speed scannino receiver utilizes a multi-band DF (Direction Finding) antenna system allowing security personnel to locate nearby cell phones in
heither standby mode* or during active voice, text or data RF transmissions making it the perfect tool
for enforcing your NJI WIRELESS security policy. Instead of illegal and unsafe cellular jamming signals
Wolfhoundm-PRO Cell Phone Detector prevents wireless usage by detecting and even locating the
perpetrator. Wolfhound-PRO'S simple trackball/pushbutton operation and ultra-bright OLED screen
make it easy to use for both trained and untrained security personnel.
