You have heard about this technologies protecting your Notebook from
the evil lurking out there in the Net.

What do they do exactly? How to use their methods for LI?
This session shall give an overview about the methods and the way
they can help improving LI in a world communicating in packets.

Anti-SPAM ! Overview

© Utimaco Safeware AG 2008

! Basics
aka Email-Filtering, used in
automated techniques.
Some of these depend upon
rejecting email from Internet sites
known or likely to send spam.
Others rely on automatically
analyzing the content of email
messages and weeding out those
which resemble spam.

Anti-SPAM ! LI implications
! Filters can help, but can also be evaded, if not kept upto-date

! Mass data (in average 80% of email is SPAM) needs to
be (pre-)handled, but can never be 100% correct

! Different approaches targeting the same goal can
increase accuracy

Anti-Virus ! Overview

© Utimaco Safeware AG 2008

! Basics
identifies and removes SW viruses,
or any kind of malware. Several
methods exist to identify malware.
Signature based detection is
limited as it can only identify a
limited amount of emerging threats.
Suspicious behavior monitors the
behavior of all programs. If one tries
to write data to an executable
program, the antivirus alerts.
Sophisticated AV-SW uses
heuristic analysis to identify new
malware.

Anti-Virus ! LI implications
! Signatures must be kept up-to-date, using them for LI
purposes requires a repository to keep track.

! False positives are likely, as well as false negatives

© Utimaco Safeware AG 2008

! A secured environment is necessary to find information
covered by something which poses a threat to the LI
system.

IDS/IPS ! Overview

© Utimaco Safeware AG 2008

! Basics
is SW a/o HW designed to
detect/prevent unwanted attempts
to manipulate a PC.
A statistical anomaly based
system establishes a performance
baseline based on normal network
traffic evaluations.
A signature based system
examines network traffic for
preconfigured and predetermined
attack patterns.

IDS/IPS ! LI implications
! The interception access point dominates the LI
approach.

! Again: False positives are likely, as well as false
negatives

DPI ! Overview

© Utimaco Safeware AG 2008

! Basics
DPI is a form of computer network
packet filtering that examines the
data and/or header part of a
packet as it passes an inspection
point.
It enables advanced security
functions as well as internet data
mining.
DPI combines the functionality of
IDS, IPS and Stateful Firewalls to
have the ability to look at Layer 2
through Layer 7 of the OSI model.

! Keywords
w Traffic access point
w Intercepting proxy
server
w Protocol-awareness

12

DPI ! LI implications
! Layer 7 interception needs understanding of the ever
changing world of protocols.

! TA8 a4 4$e 3rong 'lace2 an; you‘ll never see your 
target.

! Layer 2 technologies like MPLS can be cumbersome

13

Summary
! Keep track of your trigger criterias in a kind of repository
! Keep your trigger criterias up-to-date
! Automation never produces 100% results, but greatly
reduces the workload for human intelligence.
! The key is tuning the sensitivity (balancing false pos.
against false neg.)

! Mind your point of access to the network
! Protocol-awareness is crucial
