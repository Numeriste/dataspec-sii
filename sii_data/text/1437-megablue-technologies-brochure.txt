Harnessing technology, for a safer future.

EMBASSY PERIMETER PROTECTION

DNA-Tracker® - RPC Analyser®
DNA-Tracker's Repeat Perimeter Contact Analyser is a cost-effective, hardware

and software solution, which identifies repeat contact with mobile devices
within a set distance of a protected perimeter.
The Analyser processes captured data in real-time, displays the relevant
information, (device ID codes, triangulated position, dates, times and contact
durationL onto control room screens, or laptops for temporary deployments,
thus highlighting patterns of interest.
The system then creates alerts and builds a database of such repeat contacts,
which will assist those engaged in the protection of sensitive perimeters such as
Embassies, Airports, Military Installations, along with Oil and Gas Plants.
The Pattern Analyser could identify devices that are being carried on 'recce' and
'rehearsal' expeditions.
The captured data can provide viable lines of enquiry; and the patterns may
assist when planning pro-active operations.
