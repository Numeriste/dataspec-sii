Wireless Camera Units
The camera units are installed with Day/Night cameras, 100Mw transmitters
(higher power can be requested). Each unit has 10 channels to avoid frequency
conflict. The cameras are programmed to remain in stand-by until alarm is received
or remote control signal is received to switch them on. With the supplied battery
pack, the cameras will remain powered for up to 6 months in stand-by mode.

Wireless Sensor Units
The VIP KIT will operate with up 8 remote wireless sensors. Standard supply is 4 x
PIR units and 4 x Door Contact units. Alternative sensors can be supplied upon
request.
Each wireless unit is supplied with fully rechargeable battery packs giving up to 3
days power, transmitting on or around 836MHz frequency.
All sensors are directly controlled by the Master Wireless Communication Station
installed in the control case. The MWCS will communicate every 3 seconds with
the remote sensors, interrogating each unit for details of Battery level,
Temperature and Signal Strength. Any change below accepted thresholds will set
of the system alarm.
When the alarm signal is received and status of the MWCS advises anything other
than battery loss, the remote control can be pressed to automatically switch on the
cameras in the required area. If the system alarm is not attended to within 20
seconds, the cameras will automatically switch on and the DVR will automatically
start to record.
An optional GSM module can be installed to allow transmission of alarm status by
SMS to pre-programmed cellular number.

Audio Control & External Wired Cameras
The system is built to accept 4 external wired camera units. The system will
display, either the Wireless or the Wired cameras through the built in Quad
Multiplexer and built in TFT monitor.
To monitor 8 cameras, an external monitor can be used and connected to the
system through an external switcher attached to the built in BNC Video Output
sockets.
All Audio is controlled through the case mounted panel. Individual channels can be
opened or closed for real time listening and DVR audio controls can also be
adjusted from this panel.
