Digital Miniature Video Recorder – DMV-1k/CF
General
The DMV-1k/CF is an extremely small solid-state video and audio recorder, able to record videos with
full TV speed and resolution. A microphone amplifier for a direct microphone connection is integrated.
Its small size makes it especially suitable for tasks where covert recordings are necessary. The video
and audio files are stored to an exchangeable Compact Flash-card. The speed for the High Quality
Mode (HQ) and the Long Play Mode (LP) can be configured according to the storage capacity of the
Compact Flash.
A battery charge lasts for at least 45 minutes. A CMOS camera (5 V, 160 mA) can be directly supplied
by the recorder.
