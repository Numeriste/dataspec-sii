The FinFly USB provides an easy-to-use and reliable way of
installing Remote Monitoring Solutions on computer
systems when physical access is available.
Once the FinFly USB is inserted into a computer, it
automatically installs the configured software with
little or no user-interaction and does not require
IT-trained Agents when being used in operations. The
FinFly USB can be used against multiple systems before

The FinFly USB was successfully used by Technical
Surveillance Units in several countries to deploy
a Remote Monitoring Solution onto Target Systems that
were switched off, by simply booting the system from
the FinFly USB device.

A Source in a domestic terror group was given a FinFly
USB that secretly installed a Remote Monitoring
Solution on several computers of the group when they
were using the device to exchange documents between
each other. The Target Systems could then be remotely
monitored from Headquarters, and the FinFly USB was
later returned by the Source.
