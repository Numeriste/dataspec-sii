Wifi Interception

Modern means of communication such as mobile and fixed access to
the Internet, constantly expanding the possibilities for criminal use
of new media. Communication via the Internet complicates the
implementation of the lawful interception of communications
because of the multitude of technologies.
WiFi allows mobile access to Internet through wireless connections in
several places, which confronts the authorities and security
agencies with additional difficulties.
