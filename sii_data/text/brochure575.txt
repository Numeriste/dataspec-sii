Tri-band GSM Audio Surveillance System
The Informer is the third generation of our hardwired audio
surveillance system. Its unique performance, size and cutting
edge power management makes this system truly one of a
kind.

Audio
The Informer can be called by, or triggered to call, any
telephone anywhere in the world allowing audio monitored via
2 high quality Knowles shoelace microphones. It is
possible to switch between the microphones and control of the
gain via a telephone (GSM and or landline)

GSM
The Informer has a tri-band GSM module allowing the
system to be deployed in any GSM network around the globe

Tracking
It is possible to live track the Informer from the CP2 software
via SMS or Data. CP2 will display the Cell Id of the position of
the Informer (provided with a Cell Id database CP2 can link
the CellIdto a position on the map)

Timers
The Informer it self can be configured via various timers and
triggers to report back to the CP2 software or/and a telephone.

In/outputs
The Informerhas 2 inputs and 2 outputs.
The inputs can trigger the Informer to dial a preprogrammed
telephone number allowing monitoring to begin. E.g. a car door
switch can activate a SMS message containing Cell Id, GSM
signal strength and the status of the In & outputs to be send to
a mobile telephone or the CP2 software -and then dial up for
a audio connection.
One of the outputs can be configured to activate an RF
beacon (optional) when GSM coverage is lost or activate a
in-vehicle device such as a local recording device
( optional).
