Blue Coat SG8100 Quick Start
This Blue Coat Quick Start Guide describes how to rack-mount the Blue Coat SG8100 and explains the initial
configuration methods.

The Blue Coat SG8100 is shipped with the following components:
• Blue Coat SG8100 appliance • Disk drives and carriers
• Null-modem serial cable

• Power cords

• Packet: Safety/Conformity

• Packet: Software license sticker card/software license agreement
For initial configuration, you must know the following. Use the back page of this document to record
this information.
• IP address, subnet mask, gateway
and DNS to be assigned.

• Administration access names and passwords to be
assigned to this SG8100.

• Physical location on the network.

• (Optional, 5.x and later) Application Delivery
Network (ADN) goals and traffic intercept choices.

The Blue Coat SG8100 ships with the mounting brackets already attached to the appliance. Slide the
appliance into the rack and secure each bracket ear to the front rack posts (two screws each side, not
supplied).
Note:The mounting brackets are attached in the front position when shipped. If you wish to mount
your appliance using the middle mounting points, you must relocate the brackets yourself.

Blue Coat SG8100 Quick Start

Verify that the Blue Coat SG8100 has powered on successfully:
a. The Power LED lights up amber while the appliance is booting up. Once booted up, the
LED will blink from green to amber while the appliance is not configured. When the
appliance is configured, the LED will turn solid green.
b. The Disk Drive LEDs indicate the following:
•

If the LED is off, no disk is installed.

•

If the LED is solid green, a disk is installed.

•

If the LED randomly blinks from green to amber, there is disk activity.

•

If the LED blinks steadily from green to amber, the disk is bad or ready to be removed.

c. The LAN LEDs indicate the following:
•

Orange: If solid, there is a 10 BaseT connection. If blinking, there is 10 BaseT activity.

•

Blue: If solid, there is a 100 BaseT connection. If blinking, there is 100 BaseT activity.

•

Pink: If solid, there is a 1000 BaseT connection. If blinking, there is 1000 BaseT activity.

d. The LCD displays Blue Coat when the appliance is powered on. Once booted up, the
LCD reads IP Address not configured or, if configured, it will scroll through the health
statistics of the appliance.
e. The System Management LED alerts the user to any problems the appliance may be
experiencing.
•

If the LED if off, there is no status on the health of the appliance.

•

If the LED is solid green, the system is ok.

•

If the LED is solid amber, there is a minor system problem.

•

If the LED is blinking red, there is a major system problem.

Blue Coat SG8100 Quick Start

If this SG8100 shipped with
SGOS 4.2.x installed, you
can use the front panel or a
serial console to configure
the initial network settings.
You can also access a
Web-based wizard from a
PC residing on the same
subnet.

If this SG8100 shipped with SGOS 5.1.x (or later) installed,
you have two choices:
•

Use the front panel or serial console to assign the
appliance IP, DNS, and gateway addresses, then access
a Web-based wizard to set access credentials, configure
Application Delivery Network (ADN) options, and select
what traffic type(s) to intercept.

•

Continue with the front panel or serial console connection
to set access credentials.

Note: Determine your software version by examining the software serial number labels shipped
with the system.

Problem:
One or more of my Disk Drive LEDs are not on, but drives are installed.
Solution:
The disk might not be set in securely. Open the front panel, lift the latch to release the problem drive, pull
drive out a bit, re-insert and secure the latch closed. Check the front panel to see if the Disk Drive light is
now on. If it is not, the drive may need to be replaced.
Problem:
The Power and Disk Drive LEDs are green, but there is no network connection.
Solution:
Check the network connections to verify they are not loose. Otherwise, the problem might be a bad network
cable or possibly a problem with your router/switch. Refer to page 4 for a description of what each LED
means.
Problem:
I cannot access the Web Setup Wizard from my browser.
Solution:
Attempt one or more of the following, as required:
❐

Attempt to access an external site, such as www.bluecoat.com, to verify Internet connectivity.

❐

Ensure that the IP address you entered begins with https and is on port 8083.

❐

Verify all SG8100 network connections.

❐

Once the appliance is configured, the Web Setup Wizard is not available. If you suspect this
SG8100 has already been configured, but you require the configurations to change, you can reset
the appliance to its factory defaults from the serial console. Refer to the Blue Coat SG8100 Series
Installation Guide.
