Praline Geographic Information Systems

Geographic information system (GIS)
technology can be used for scientific
investigations, resource management,
and development pla nning. For example,
a GIS might allow emergency planners to
easily calculate emergency response
times in the event of a·natural disaster, or

need protection from pollution.
KTP is a platform independent WEB-GIS

such as job statistics, social media data,
spa-tial data etc.

Most of GIS projects "'eed owner
who has developed projects from
zero point. While developing these
type of applications most of steps
are duplicat-ed. But KTP requires
less development for any GIS
project. Users wherever they are
can access data via any web
browser frominternet or intranet.
Other benefits of using KTP are as
follows;
• Independent map server
~
• Dynamic and real time data presentation
• Independent platform
....
• No duplicated effort during
development of tracking programs
• Impact analysis
• Transportation safety and security
• Resource management
• Cost savings resulting from better
efficiency
• Better decision making
• Improved communication
