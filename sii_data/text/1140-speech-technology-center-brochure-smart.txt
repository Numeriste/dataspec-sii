indexed by date, time, duration, channel number,
keywords, DTMF codes, comments
Database is equipped with sorting and filtering
functions
Access to sound database via LAN and dial-up
connection
High quality recording with or without
compression allowing further procedures over
sound such as speaker identification, noise
filtering or other signal processing
Telephone interface is galvanically separated
from the line and has high input impedance to
prevent detection
DTMF codes, CallerID and other service signals,
pulse dialed numbers recognition
Playback of recorded signals without recording
process interruption
Built-in convenient tool for text decoding of
recorded speeches
Selectable playback speed without voice pitch
distortion
Linking between the typed text and the
corresponding sound fragment
Instant access to any previously recorded sound
or typed text
Sound data export in *.WAV (Windows) or
*.DAT(STC/SIS) format
Operator control is optional
