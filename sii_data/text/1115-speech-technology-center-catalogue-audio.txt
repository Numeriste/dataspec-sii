Smart Ringer Applications
Notification of personnel: security and emergency services.
In the event of an emergency, Smart Ringer immediately informs
a circle of responsible persons to take necessary measures. The
system sends the notifications to stationary or mobile phones.
Subscribers who have received messages can confirm receipt by
voice command, for example, by saying his/ her name. The system
records all notification responses.

Automatic outgoing calls: contact centers.
Smart Ringer can be used in contact centers as a separate module
for automatic outgoing calls. Once the contacts database is loaded
manually or automatically (CRM integrated database systems) and
the call script is configured, the system is ready for use.
When subscribers answer incoming calls, Smart Ringer provides
them with the desired information. If subscribers request further
information, calls are transferred to contact center agents for
follow-up.

EMERGENCY NOTIFICATION

Smart Ringer can manage a large number of calls in a short
period of time (co ld calls), w hile transferring only interested,
potential customers to ca ll centers (warm calls).
Optimize call center workforce
Reduce operating costs
Agents only answer important ca lls

Subscriber notification: telecommunication and Internet
service providers
• Inform subscribers about new services and promotions
• Alert subscribers to service interruptions or emergencies
Smart Ringer can be usefully integrated wi th an organization's
information system. It makes ca lls automatically and provides
subscribers with important or urgent information recorded using
a microphone (or from audio files). After notification has been
sent, the system creates a report that is then sent back to the
organization.

Sound Cleaner operates like a mosaic.
Users can combine modules (processes) in any sequence, designing
tailor-made signal processing routines that start from sound input.
Each process in the routine receives a signal from the previous module
in the chain, applies its own algorithm and passes the processed signal
on to the next module.
The number of modules combined into a single routine is limited only
by the processing power of the PC used.

Features

• Effective suppression of all types of noises and distortions
• Adaptive filtering algorithms
Filters can be combined to process noisy recordings
simultaneously
Results saved in *.wav format
Real-time noise suppression; filter settings can be changed
without interrupting playback

Filters and Features
Equalizer

Adaptive Broadband Filter

One of Sound Cleaner's distinctive features is a parametric
equalizer combined with spectrum analyzer, which allows changes
to be monitored in real- time.

The adaptive broadband filter is based on an adaptive frequency
algorithm designed to suppress broadband, periodic noises and
interference from electrical pick-ups and mechanical vibrations,
interior and exterior environments, communication channels and
recording equipment.

The equalizer operates in automatic and semi-automatic modes,
and can be manually tuned to make fine spectrum adjustments.
The filter is ideal for use on recordings that contain stationary
noises, such as power-line, mechanical and engine noises, etc.
It suppresses a signa l's stationary components regardless of
frequency and location. It can also be used to raise the amplitude in
a specific spectral band.

These noises, which come across as hum, rumb ling, hisses or roars,
are nearly impossible to remove with other methods, including
one-channel adaptive filtration , spectrum smoothing and equalizers,
because they are spread across the entire spectrum and intersect
with the speech signal.

Adaptive Inverse Filtration

Adaptive Compensation

Adaptive inverse filter is based on the adaptive spectral correction
algorithm, sometimes called adaptive spectral smoothing.
Adaptive inverse filter effectively suppresses strong periodic
noises from electrical pick-ups or mechanical vibrations, thus
recovering speech signal and equalizing signal AFC. It amplifies
weaker signal components and suppresses the stronger ones at
the same time. The average spectrum therefore tends to approach
the flat spectrum unmasking the speech signal and improving its
intelligibility.

The adaptive compensation process uses an adaptive filtering
algorithm for one-channel adaptive compensation. It is most
effective for narrow-band stationary and regular interferences.
The filter adjusts itself smoothly, maintaining signal quality.
Except frequency compensation, adaptive compensation removes
both narrowband stationary interference and regular interference
(e.g. vibration , power-line pickups. noise from electrical devices,
steady music, interior environment. motor vehicle and water noise,
reverberation, etc.).

Impulse Filtration

Text Report

Adaptive impulse filter automatically restores speech and
musical fragments that have been masked or distorted by pulse
interferences, such as clicks, radio noises, knocks, etc. During
impulse filtration, Sound Cleaner suppresses these pulses by
substituting them with smoothed and weakened interpolated
signa ls, thereby effectively increasing audio signal intelligibility.

Sound Cleaner software lets users store processing parameters
and current configurations in text files, as well as upload their own
templates. The new screenshot feature lets active windows be
captured and pasted as illustrations into text files. These features
help users generate detailed, illustrated professional reports indispensible for reinforcing expert testimony in court.

Adaptive Stereo Filter

Settings and Preferences

Sound Cleaner provides two different kinds of stereo processing:
two-channel signal processing and adaptive stereo filtering.
In two-channel signal processing, the sound in each channel is
processed independently. In adaptive stereo filtering, data from a
reference channel is used to filter the signal in the primary channel.
Stereo filter is the ideal solution for recordings made from two
microphones.

Sound Cleaner lets users save all settings and tailor-made
processing routines and combinations - an invaluable feature for
repeat processing in similar environments.

32

The software also includes a spectrum saving filter that prepares
audio files for further identification analysis.

against voice recordings obtained from
different sources such as cell phones,
land lines, covert recordings and
recorded investigative interviews.

Data storage and transmission are
secured by:
• HTIPS protocol
• Access rights assigned according to
operator group, rank and/or function
•Tracking and recording of all operator
actions
• Measures to eliminate password theft
in the workplace

Voice sample quality:
Handles speech patterns from various
sources, delivering high-quality results
with low-quality samples.

Voice biometrics
The human voice is a unique feature that is useful in biometric
identification over a wide range of both government and commercial
applications. It has proven value within law enforcement as an
investigative tool and within the telecommunications industry for both
identification and verification uses. Voice recording is recognized as
a non-invasive technology and therefore can be easy to introduce
in both passive and active modes across multiple markets and
applications.
