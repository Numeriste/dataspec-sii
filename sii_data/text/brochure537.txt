The equipment operates either inside or outside the
target environment and can be used in most
surveillance conditions including hostile environments.

RF jamming
Eskan's intelligent and adaptive jamming solutions,
through programmable hand held, portable and vehicle
based jamming equipment, have been developed to
protect law enforcement and military personnel from
the danger of explosive devices using RF triggered
detonators, and to prevent radio frequency surveillance
and tactical information leaks from cell phones.

Observer 16
Multi-channel video receiver and recorder

Observer l 6
Multi-channel video receiver and recorder

A portable video receiver and recorder system with
tactical surveillance at i t s heart. Operating with cameras,
micro hones and transmitters, the Observer 16 has been
speci ~callydesigned for government security and law
enforcement users.

p

All the receiving and recording components have been designed for
rapid set-up and ease of use.The Observer 16 combines an 8 channel
digital receiver, two diversity down-converters, two antennae and a
16 channel video recorder with 4 channels audio in one portable
carrying case.
The colour LCD screen, for viewing live or recorded video, is
conveniently mounted in the case lid and can be operated by a hand
held remote control unit, by mouse operation or from keys on the
case panel.This video surveillance system enables the operator to
view and record wired video input on 15-channels and on one built-in
RF channel on which the operator can view or record on any of the 8
radio frequency channels.
The Digital video and audio recorder system is supplied with a video
transmitter,video camera and microphone transmitter. The system

Remote visual and audio surveillance

Using the remote control facility the operator can select one of up to
three attached video cameras on each transmitter. The video signal can
be scrambled and the digital audio signal encrypted remotely to prevent
unauthorised access.This is enabled with a separate control frequency
making the EURX 30 ideal for covert visual and audio surveillance.

Hand held cell phone detector
Developed primarily for law enforcement and military agencies, the
Palladium M I is an intelligent hand held detector which monitors
GSM and 3G bands for cell phone aaivity - t o protect against
information leakage o r covert tracking operations.Any cell phone
signals are confirmed through the built-in pulse timing analyser.The
Palladium M I detects cell phones whether they are in aaive o r
stand-by mode.
The Palladium M I has a choice of detection alarm signals - visual,
audible o r both. Each has adjustable alarm thresholds which can be
configured t o operate for pre-selected transmission types.
Both alarm signals, thresholds and frequency bands are configured
either through the user friendly display and illuminated
programming keys o r via a USB connection t o a personal
computecThe unit will remember the last configuration even when
the batteries are removed.The USB computer connection has also
been designed for downloading Palladium M I firmware updates and
for integration with other counter-surveillance systems.
The Palladium M I is powered by internal batteries o r from
external sources.

range of innovative and sophisticated hand held and compact
detectors which are easy to operate and have the power and
features associated with much larger systems.
The vibration alert mode allows continuous live monitoring of
meetings.When a radio frequency signal has been detected the
Palladium G 12 can confirm if there is a listening device, such as
a modified mobile phone, being used in the meeting space.
The 2 band Palladium receiver with its selectable antennas has
excellent detection capabilities of high frequencies, and of
lower power transmitters including RF devices operating on
telephone wires.
The Palladium G 12 can
detect a radio link repeater
being used to enhance the
signal received from a
room microphone; it can
also be used for continuous
discrete monitoring of
tracking systems.

Detection wit out a trace
Ranger 3 can detect and analyse transmission devices without any
trace of the detecti0n.A silent sweep with an ultrasonic signal ensures
discrete detection without alerting the surveillance systems which
could compromise your confidentiality. Any surveillance agent will not
be alerted by an ultrasonic tone.The sonic labelling technique, pioneered
by Eskan in the Ranger, is a powerful method of detecting room
transmitters - ideal when monitoring sensitive sites. It can locate a
surveillance device and accurately display the distance from the receiver.

Comprehensive detection capability
Using 4 built-in receivers operating simultaneously Ranger 3 can detect
the whole range of transmission and provides a detailed analysis

the disruption of cell phone communication, the ESK 823Jwill
prevent leakage of sensitive information via cell phones, disable
satellite tracking device cell phone reporting systems, and prevent
cell phone activation of remotely controlled equipment
By disrupting network signals t o nearby cell phones, the ESK 823)
prevents the cell phones from establishing a call, or receiving or
sending a text message.The ESK 823J can be programmed for
accurate jamming of cell phones by selecting the country of use,
and by selecting the output power t o control the jamming radius.
Concentration on the required frequency bands and control of
output power extends the working life of the jammer's batteries.
Both output power and accurate frequency band selection are
configured either through the user friendly display and illuminated
programming keys or via a USB connection t o a personal
computer.The unit will remember the last configuration even when
the batteries are removed.The USB computer connection has also
been designed for downloading ESK 823Jfirmware updates and for
integration with other counter-surveillance systems.

The ability of the operators to understandwhat the target is saying
without using a laboratory to remove all the unwanted noise has been
one of the major operational problems with receivers.
KOmbat MYC the pocket sized m e w i n m d y eliminates background
noise and provides crystal clear and understandablevoice quality
reception.This is achieved by the operator selecting one of the 8 levels
of Digital Signal h e s s i n g (DSP) to match the environmental noise
whether from air conditioning, from a building site, or from deliberatety
introduced noise.
Higher sensitivity allows the operator to be further away giving more
operational flexibili.Thi is achieved by several levels of RF
amplification enabling the receiver to respond to weaker signals, thus
extending the range of the transmitters being used.The inbuilt filtering
arrangements also give the operator a high degree of proteaion from
interference.

Shadow 5000
Listening through the wall
You don't need to know the type of wall in advance. If your target
is the other side of a solid or cavity wall even in poor surveillance

conditions, you can listen locally or remotely. Quick and easy to
set up for temporary surveillance.
The optical accelerometers and control unit, with its 3 levels of
DSP noise elimination t o enhance the intelligible voice signals, are
designed for instant stereo imaging over 12 metres apart giving an
accurate picture of what is happening on the other side of the wall.
The Shadow 5000 is also

I

equipped with solid rod
microphones which use t h e
wall as a sound receptor
and do not need. t o go
totally through the wall.
The equipment is designed
for use in most conditions
including under water.
