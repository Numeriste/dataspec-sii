Qosmos ixEngine is a DPI and metadata
extraction software development kit
used by TEMs and Solution Vendors to embed
state of the art flow decoding technology
into their applications.

Application Program

High performance
The only DPI SDK that can handle a data
plane of 10 Gbps on Linux
Optimized for multicore processors such as
Cavium, Tilera and NetLogic
Many configuration options enable
developers to optimize integration

Qosmos ready-to-use software reduces
development cycles, costs and risks
Developers can focus on building complete
solutions and rely on Qosmos for its domain
expertise in protocol, application and
metadata extraction
Future-proof technology with continuously
updated protocols and applications

ixEngine delivers complete visibility into
network traffic in real time, including protocol
and application classification and the delivery
of communication metadata. This enables
developers to inject application-level insight into

Independent core decoding engine and
protocol plugin library for fast protocol
updates while preserving engine stability

Technology at a glance
Designed with developers in mind, ixEngine
accelerates the product development cycle.
Ready-to-use software libraries reduce effort
and lower risks associated with developing
and maintaining a highly complex technology

Classification of network flows using stateful
Deep Packet Inspection and statistical
protocol identification
Real-time extraction of metadata and content
from traffic flows

internally.

Correlation at flow, session, application,
service and user levels

Beyond DPI
Qosmos delivers enhanced Network Intelligence

1000+ protocol and application plugins to
classify flows and extract information

by going beyond traditional DPI to also extract

Designed for:

protocol and application metadata, enabling
detailed understanding of network transactions
up to the application level.

Memory footprint
400 KB for the full set of protocol &

mechanisms to activate/deactivate depending
on feature and performance requirements:

Flexible integration
Tunable ratio for granularity of flow analysis/
packet processing rate to fit your application
requirements

Protocol signature using Layer 7 stateful DPI
(no use of TCPIUDP ports)

User-defined metadata extraction

Statistical protocol recognition

Switchable IP and TCP flow reassembly
process for packet reordering

Automatic de-capsulation of tunneledl
encapsulated traffic

Customizable early packet discard
mechanism

Operates on fragmented, duplicated,
de-sequenced packets

Optional packet pre-filtering: depending on
application requirements, all packets or only
a subset of packets are parsed by ixEngine
(e.g. classification only requires the first
packets of a flow)

Operates on bidirectional and unidirectional
traffic
Parsing of IP flows enables real-time
extraction of traffic metadata (caller, type of
file downloaded, IMSI, etc.) and content (e.g.
email text or VolP stream based on RTP data)
Advanced condition-matching mechanism
based on session context to filter data and
packets
High-speed keyword search leveraging flow
metadata
Delivery of structured traffic information over
simple APls
Protocol Plugin Creator to easily build
additional, customized protocol plugins
Debugging information delivery to secure
implementation

Qosmos SessionizerTM
ixEngine dynamic session context contains
flow identification and observed metadata
Session context is available to users (e.g.
for packet management leveraging flow
metadata)
Correlation of control and data sessions
Inheritance of traffic attributes on correlated
sessions (e.g. SIP session attribute "caller"
inherited in RTP session state)

Performance
Scalability up t o core network speeds at 10's
of Gbps
Optimized symmetric multiprocessing (SMP)
support for scalability up to 96 cores
Optimized code for the industry's highest
performance multicore processors such as
Cavium Octeon, NetLogic and Tilera TilePro
