DATA SHEET

DPX NETWORK PROBE
DPX Network Probe is a passive IP probe for lawful interception, mass interception and network monitoring. It uses
ipoque's deep packet inspection (DPI) technology to identify and filter network flows according to their application
protocol. Target triggers comprise protocol-specific filtering criteria including network addresses, user names, protocolspecific attributes and arbitrary content keywords. This unique combination of DPI and flexible target rules delivers high
quality interception data while avoiding the capturing of a large volume of unnecessary network traffic. It significantly
reduces the burden on subsequent processing and mediation systems.

ADVANCED DPI ENGINE

POWERFUL TARGET TRIGGERING

DPX Network Probe uses PACE, ipoque's fieldproven deep packet inspection (DPI) engine t o
enable target triggering and filtering based on
communication protocol and application.

DPX Network Probe features a powerful rules engine that combines traffic identification criteria
with versatile actions specifying how matching
traffic will be handled. The traffic identification
criteria allow to match on specific targets and
opplication flows and to filter out irrelevant data
that would otherwise overlood the post-processing chain. The string search engine enables
matching on arbitrary payload keywords ond
virtual identities such as e-mail addresses, IM
user names and SIP phone numbers.

Layer-2-4 Filters
IP addresses, port numbers and ranges
Black- and whitelists for IP, MAC and MPLS
All trigger criteria listed above can be combined
(e.g. layer-7 protocol AND IP address AND
e-mail address). DPX Network Probe supports
large rule sets with up to 25,000 concurrent
rules per system or per blade.

TRAFFIC PROCESSING BY RULE ACTIONS
The action part of a rule defines how to act on
a match by a trigger criterion, allowing to forward the Content of Communication (CC) and
Intercept Related Information (IRI) OS required
by ETSI.
