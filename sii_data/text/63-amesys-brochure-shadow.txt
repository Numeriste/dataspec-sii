SMART INTELLIGENT
JAMMING SOLUTIONS

SHADOW is on Intelligent or Smart reactive Jammer, which means :
• it jams only when necessary,
• it g11rnanlP.P.S a r>P.rmanP.nl 5urvP.illanc:e of the c.omr>IP.te Sf'lP.<.trum,
• it jams outomoncolly with on optimized countermeasure and reoctivily
adopted to the targeted communication,
• it reduces people exposure to radiation,
• it saves power for others potential threats and con engage a large
number of communica tions at a some time for urban use.
This unique technology allows using this platform for several applications
with adopted configurations such as dedicated antennas, power amplifiers
or specific grophicol user interlaces...

PROTECT - Counter RCIED
• Smort reactive jamming (jams only when necessary with on
adopted countermeasure)
• Instantaneous detection ond indentilicotion on the complete
frequency bond wilh a Probability Of Intercept of 100%
• limited people exposure lo rodiotions withou t decreasing the
protection
• Protection perimeter ol 100 meters around the BLACK Shadow
with more than 2000 countermeasures engaged simultaneously

CONTROL - Directive jamming
• Spectrum monitoring
• Directive long distance jamming (more than l km}
• Selective communication blocking according to the targeted
commu nicotion
• Jammer emits only when the targeted communication is active

LISTEN - COMINT
• Instantaneous detection and identification on the complete
frequency bond
• Very high sensirivity receiver and specially adopted system to
Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum communications
• Communications chorocterizolion
• Demodulation and decod ng ol seleded targets
• Recording feature available

FI ND - Tactical direction find ing
• Instantaneous detection and identification on 1he complete
frequency bond
• Direction finding @ 5° RM S
• This Mode con be combined with Listen and Control modes
