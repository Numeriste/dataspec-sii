Remote Monitoring & Infection Solutions
FINSPY

FinSpy is a field-proven Remote Monitoring Solution that
enables Governments to face the current challenges of
monitoring Mobile and Security-Aware Targets that
regularly change location, use encrypted and anonymous communication channels and reside in foreign
countries.
Traditional Lawful Interception solutions face new challenges
that can only be solved using active systems like FinSpy:
· Data not transmitted over any network
· Encrypted Communications
· Targets in foreign countries
FinSpy has been proven successful in operations around
the world for many years, and valuable intelligence has
been gathered about Target Individuals and Organizations.
When FinSpy is installed on a computer system it can be
remotely controlled and accessed as soon as it is connected to the internet/network, no matter where in the
world the Target System is based.

and bug-fixes from the FinSpy Update server.

The Target License controls how many FinSpy Targets can
be active in parallel.

B. Agent License
The Agent License controls how many FinSpy Agents can
login to the FinSpy Master in parallel.
Example:
· 5 Agent Licenses are purchased.

Screenshot inactive Target without License

Active refers to activated FinSpy Target installations no
matter whether the Target System is online or offline.
When FinSpy Target is deployed on a Target System and
no Target Licenses are available, the FinSpy Target gets
temporary deactivated and no recording and live access will
be possible. As soon as a new License is available (e.g. by
upgrading the existing License or de-infecting one of the
active FinSpy Targets), the Target will be assigned the free
license and it will be activated and begin recording and providing live access.
