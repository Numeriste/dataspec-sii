ANPR overview
Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) systems
continuously scan and read number plates under various
lighting and weather conditions, comparing them against
a database or "hotlist" of wanted vehicles. If a scanned
plate matches a plate in the database, the system records

Number plates collected by both fîxed and mobile systems
are stored, along with colour pictures of the vehicle and
location data. The database is fully searchable and can be
analysed to assist with law enforcement, city and traffic
planning, parking usage and capacity and much more.

productivity and effectiveness. ANPR databases can also
be customised to the user's specific requirements, for
example; Police services can utilise crime databases and
private companies can use authorised lists of employees
or residents for access control or parking management.

Data from ANPR systems can assist in collecting parking
fees, unpaid fines or tickets, improper permits, and much
more. Users can quickly identify these vehicles and
capture lost revenue.

The NDl-RS Talon™ Recognition Engine represents an
alternative direction to conventional OCR template or
rule based solutions in solving the challenges associated
with ANPR. lnstead of relying on these conventional
processes, Talon uses pattern recognition techniques
incorporating neural networks. Neural networks offer

additional country plate reading capabilities can be
added by retraining with new video data. ln a European,

much greater potential in terms of performance than
conventional pattern recognition methods. The networks
are not programmed in the traditional sense but are trained
by example on a large number of repetitions of character
sets. As a result, the network builds a statistical model
which focuses on the features making each individual
character distinctive, rather than forming a definitive.

Fixed ANPR systems are ideal for strategic monitoring
and data collection along roadways, bridges, tunnels, key
road junctions, entrances to buildings, or other critical
infrastructure. NDl-RS fixed camera installations can
be attached to buildings, available street furniture, or
overpasses in specific locations such as choke points,
high-traffic routes or geographical boundaries.

ANPR systems improve safety and enhance

investigations by continuously monitoring vehicles and
matching them against databases 24 hours a day, seven
days a week. Vehicles of interest generate alerts that
can be monitored in a command centre, e-mailed to
authorised personnel, or communicated to a mobile
system. The high vo lume of data generated can be stored
in the VISCE™ Back Office Intelligence system for later
searches or analysis.

Mobile Solutions
Mobile ANPR solutions from NDl -RS are ideal for tactical
operations, providing additional 'reach' and fle xibility
to your organisation. Typically mounted on a vehicle a
mobile ANPR system captures plate numbers and colour
images, analyses the reads, generates alerts for plates of
interest and stores ail of the data from multiple lanes of
traffic while the vehicle is being driven.
Ali of the information collected can be searched, analysed,
and stored in the VISCE™ Back Office Intelligence system.
Mobile ANPR systems can identify improperly registered
vehicles; vehicles with unpaid tickets, licences, or permits;
or vehicles that aren't authorised to be in a specific
parking facility, community or restricted area. NDl-RS
mobile ANPR solutions help your organisation improve
productivity, generate revenue, and increase safety.

The Talon™ Automatic Number Plate
(ANPR) engine, since its first deployment
almost 20 years ago, has been continually
improved and enhanced and now
provides one of the highest accuracy
number plate recognition software
engines in the world .

Powerful high performance ANPR
software engine with Neural Network
Technology
Talon runs on any modern PC platform
(including Laptops and Tablets) running
the
Windows
Operating
system
equipped with a suitable frame grabber.
The engine supports multiple camera
systems allowing simultaneous multilane capture and optimum recognition
performance for stationary, low or high
speed traffic within milliseconds.

With
embedded
Neural
Network
technology in its design, Talon provides
among the highest accuracy and
recognition speeds in the industry.
lncorporating
complex
algorithms
for image management and grouping
analysis,
Talon's
neural
network
technology is able to recognise poorly
defined, distorted and unclean characters
during ail weather conditions with high
recognition accuracy. Due to the use of
grey-scale character matching the Talon
engine provides finer discriminations
than binary or OCR methods thus
ensuring a high confidence level in the
accuracy of results.
Talon can be configured to distribute
the captured data by a number of
methods, which enables any connected
client application system to store in
a SQL Database where it can be cross

engineered
to
withstand the extreme environment and

Utilising an Intel Core i7 processor, the
VP accepts inputs from up to four (4)
dual-lens V220™ ANPR cameras. The
VP processor rece ives images from t he
cameras and uses the powerful Talon™
ANPR recognition eng ine to locate
plates and interpret these into useful
data. VeriPlate™ user interface software
checks this data agai nst any number of

hotli sts managed by t he VI SCE™ Back

ANPR cameras). The VP processors have
local storage capability of up to 2 million
time stamped images with ail relevant
metadata, including GPS coordinates,
the interpreted plate read, a un ique

may be securely stored and managed
by direct connection to any web based
