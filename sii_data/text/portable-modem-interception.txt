Portable Modem Interception
The unit is a true portable modem intercept
solution to be used in operations where
direct access to the target lines is required.
This unit can be deployed in the field close
to the target or installed on a permanent
basis, for example, in a monitoring center.
Due to the unique design of the physical
line interface the system is completely
undetectable by the target and is
transparent to all parties on the line, making
it ideal for all covert operations.

1. System Summary
The system is delivered as a complete turnkey solution, including all cables and accessories.
It consists of a high quality and specially designed PSTN line interface and a lunchbox
computer for recording and decoding. It is very easy to operate and it only needs a few
hours of training to use it at its fullest potential.
The system intercepts all dialup modem traffic on a two wire analog PSTN line, and has no
influence on normal voice or fax traffic on the intercepted target line.
V.90 and V.92 is supported but will be trained down to 33.600 from the interface box
towards the target.
The target line is connected in sequence to the line interface box that in turn connects to the
lunchbox computer; power it up and you are ready to go.

You can listen to any Voice over IP traffic. The audio player contains an automatic
gain control filter to enhance the audio.
With these advanced tools you are able to follow whatever the target is doing on the internet
and easily pinpoint any illegal activity.
Information can be copied to the built-in CD or DVD writer for presentation in court or other
purposes.

The intercepted traffic is decoded into readable information for access to a broad
range of tools for dealing with the intercepted data.
