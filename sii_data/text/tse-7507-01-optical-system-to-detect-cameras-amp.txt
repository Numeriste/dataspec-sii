TSE 7507-01 Optical System to Detect Cameras, Lenses
The lens detector is designed for optimum performance over a range of 1-7 meters (3-23 ft). The lens
locator is primarily intended for use indoors. The unit can be used beyond 7 m and in outdoor
siutations, but performance will be reduced.

The most common use ofr the lens locator is to
locate hidden cameras inside a building, room, or office.
(Example: Detects hidden camouflaged lenses)

When performing an area scan, it is important to use a horizontal sweeping motion across the walls
and ceillings of the room (left to right or right to left) in a slow, methodical fashion. Scan slowly so that
time can be taken to examine the scene in the eyepiece, to detect for a red bliniking light.
Scanning at a rate of approximately 0.3m/s is recommended. However, the scan rate is highly
dependent on the operator’s skill level and familiarity with the unit. Therefore, it is stronlgy
recommende that slower scan rates be used while becoming familiar with the instrument.
As part of the TSE TSCM kit the TSE 7507-01 can overcome one of today’s major problems in counter
surveillance and that is to protect against hidden pinhole cameras. These can be installed in any
location from a boardroom to the temporary apartment of a visiting Head of State’s or even in public
places such as health club changing rooms used by celebrities. The lens locator is a small,
lightweight, laser device, which was developed for government, police and VIP use. It allows the
operator to quickly identify and locate hidden cameras.
Since the Lens Locator works optically, no amount of electronic jamming or shielding can stop it from
finding hidden cameras.
Anytime a camera can see you, or your client, the TSE 7507-01 can see the camera. The Lens Locator
will detect hidden cameras in a wide range of conditions - - inside covert packaging, in walls and
ceillings, inside EM shielding - - even when the camera is switched off.
Caution:
Class IIIa levels of laser radiation are considered, depending upon the irradiance, to be either an acute
intra beam viewing hazard of chronic viewing hazard, and an acute viewing hazard, if viewed directly
with optical instruments.
