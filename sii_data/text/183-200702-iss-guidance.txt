Session objectives
P A G E

To provide a high level overview and insight into identifying, managing and
controlling computer fraud & security threats through innovative techniques and
legally accepted process. This session will cover some of the challenges faced by
HR, Legal and Information Technology Security teams within Corporate
Organizations today, with a focus on how Guidance Software helps its customers
address, manage and add value to these challenges, working alongside industry best

Sarbanes Oxley, ISO 17799, Basel II–
Why enterprise computer forensics?
P A G E

Enterprise Computer Forensics Required for Effective Internal Investigations
Congress enacted the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Sarbanes-Oxley”) to protect investors by combating
corporate crime and improving corporate governance.2 Sarbanes-Oxley requires companies to implement
extensive corporate governance policies to prevent and respond to fraudulent activity within the company,
including vigilant self-policing to deter and quickly investigate and contain internal financial fraud.3 For example,
Sarbanes-Oxley expressly requires publicly traded companies to create anonymous hotlines for the reporting of
fraud, to investigate those instances of fraud, and certify that they have disclosed any instances of fraud
involving management and other key employees to the Board of Directors.
Well before the enactment of Sarbanes-Oxley, courts recognized the importance of preserving electronic data in
connection with litigation, including securities fraud investigations. For example, in In re Bristol-Myers Squibb
Securities Litigation,12 the court determined that the discovery of computer evidence was critical to ensure a
proper investigation of alleged corporate fraud. The court noted that as the vast majority of documentation now
exists in electronic form, electronic evidence discovery should be considered a standard and routine
practice going forward.13 The provisions of Sarbanes-Oxley will certainly induce courts and auditors to look
closely at a company’s ability to forensically preserve and analyze electronic data.
Other agencies and groups have also adopted standards regarding computer forensics. The leading
international information security best practices standard, ISO 17799, calls on enterprises to use computer
forensics to preserve the admissibility of evidence.

Enterprise Products

Data at rest

Volatile data

Forensic concurrent connections let you:

Snapshot concurrent connections let you:

! Discreetly investigate and analyze many
machines simultaneously at a disk level

! Scan more than 10,000 machines in 30 minutes

! Acquire and preserve data in a forensically
sound (court-accepted) manner
! Proactively audit groups of machines for
sensitive information

! Rapidly identify all trusted, untrusted and
unknown data
! Integrate with IDS/SIM tools to provide
actionable real time incident response
capabilities

Case Study:

Synopsys (IP Theft)
P A G E

Issue:
Synopsys believed that a former employee removed files containing corporate secrets from their
network and used these secrets to establish ‘Nassda’ and creating a competitive product.
Problem:
Synopsys needed to prove that the former employees had in fact removed the sensitive data from
their network and then used it to build Nassda’s business.
Size of the challenge:
Nassda was for obvious reasons less than cooperative and by the time Guidance Software got
involved the case was more that two years old a lots of computer evidence had been lost or
erased.
Our solution:
Using EnCase Enterprise and a court order Guidance Software was able to search through
Nassda systems and locate documents identical to those on Synopsys’ network.
Result:
“The terms of the deal call for Synopsys to acquire Nassda (including its $100 million cash
reserves) for $192 million, and for Nassda's co-founders – all of whom were one-time Synopsys
employees – to pay Synopsys a $61 million settlement. The net purchase price of $30 million
compares favorably to Nassda's earlier market cap of $500 million”
— CBS MarketWatch

Case Study:

Network Associates (M&A)
P A G E

Customer:
Network Associates
Issue:
Contracted to sell its Sniffer Technologies unit for $275 million.
Problem:
The contractual terms required Network Associates to ensure that none of Sniffer’s source code
remained on Network Associates’ computer systems.
Size of the challenge:
5,000 computers in 20 different locations worldwide (100 TB).
Our solution:
Guidance Software Professional Services used the eDiscovery suite containing all the relevant
search terms.
Result:
Guidance Software completed the engagement in 4 weeks and significantly under budget. 105
dirty machines were found.
"EnCase Enterprise saved us more than $1 million in the first six months of its use. It also allowed us
to complete a critical M&A discovery issue that would have been impossible with any other
software or services options in the market today."
- Ted Barlow, CSO & VP, Risk Management, Network Associates

Case Study:

The Hartford (Incident Response)
P A G E

Issue:
Conducting efficient incident response on a large distributed network without
disrupting operations
Problem:
During a zero day incident the Hartford needed to locate and remediate a
worm prior to getting the signature from their anti-virus company
Size of the challenge:
30,000 node network
Our solution:
EnCase Enterprise with servlets deployed throughout their network.
Result:
During a worm outbreak the Hartford was able to scan 30,000 nodes to
identify compromised machines and establish a timeline of the machine that
introduced the worm into their environment. After identifying compromised
machines they were able to remediate the malicious worm quickly without
disrupting business operations or quarantining workstations/servers.
