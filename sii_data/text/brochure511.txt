iXAM®
Zero-Footprint Forensic Acquisition for
Apple iPhon

iXAM® - an iPhone ™ and iPod Touch TM forensic imaging and
data analysis suite comprising two key applications to allow fast
and comprehensive forensic examination and reporting of live
and deleted data stored on these unique devices.
iXAM - Forensic data imaging tool: Uses a proprietary
method which requires no modification to the device
Operating System and leaves absolutely no trace on the target
device. This tool has 2 extraction modes to allow investigators
to perform the appropriate level of examination based on
importance of the device and the time available.
Forensic lmaging Mode: A full 'byte for byte ' physical memory
space image, which includes deleted data and unallocated
memory space. lncludes audit logging & MDS/SHA 1 hash
validation of every memory block.
Logica/ lmaging Mode: Allows an investigator to perform
targeted acquisition of specific key live data sets, but still using
a physical imaging technique to download the data.

iXAM iner TM - Decoding and reporting tool: Enables
investigators to interpret and present the results of a data
acquisition performed using iXAM .
Manual data carving of iPhone data is time consuming and
requires expertise and knowledge to search for case-relevant
evidence . iXAMiner automates this procedure enabling an
investigator to quickly produce a detailed and comprehensive
forensic report. Even files encoded in a proprietary Apple TM
format are decoded and presented . The software consolidates
the many different file types in to one evidence workbook,
increasing workflow rates and allowing vital data to be
presented in an easy to read and consistent format.
iXAMiner creates a Microsoft® Excel® based report suitable
for evidential submission or for exporting into other data
analysis applications.
