Defentek develops advanced systems to cover satellite interception for major mobile satellite communication
systems.
The systems can be installed on various platforms, such as vehicles, vans, shelters, fixed installations,
install
ships,
helicopters etc. They can be used either as portable stand-alone tactical systems or as front-ends integrated
with larger scale systems, such as the Intelligence Illumination Maestro Control Center.

In addition, Defentek develops Satellite Link Interception System for inter
interception
ception of global and regional
satellite communication operators (“Intelsat”, “Eutelsat”, “Arabsat”, “Domsat”, “Indosat”, etc.) including VSAT
and DCME.
The Iridium satellite constellation is a system of 66 active communication satellites with spares in orbit and on
the ground. It allows worldwide voice and data communications using handheld satellite phones. The Iridium
network is unique in that it covers the whole earth, including po
poles,
les, oceans and airways.
Iridium Interception System is intended to iintercept
ntercept information (voice, SMS, data) in IRIDIUM communication
channels.
The system is completely passive, does not interfere with satellite communication and therefore absolutely
undetectable.

The other feature of the Orbital Interception S ystem, that it is designed to intercept information transmitted
through Thuraya network channels.
The Orbital Satellite Interceptor System provides:
•
•
•
•
•

Interception of voice, fax, SMS, data and call related information
Determination of the geographical position of Thuraya terminals
Continual (24/7) operation, processing and storage of information
Full-range, flexible retrieval of stored information on user demand
Issuing of reports and recommendations based on stored information assessments

The Orbital Satellite Interceptor System can be supplied in either tactical (L-band only) or strategic
configuration (C-band with one or multiple L-band posts).
The information objects monitored by this system are: satellite systems Intelsat, Eutelsat, Arabsat, Domsat,
Indosat and other global or regional satellite communication operators.

The Orbital Satellite Interceptor System intercepts the following communication links:
•
•
•
•
•

E1/T1 standard, and their derivatives with various types of compression, including DCME and many
others
Public and private computer networks
Different standards of the global VSAT system
GSM-operators (GSM-A, Abis)
And more depending on the capabilities of the cryptologists
