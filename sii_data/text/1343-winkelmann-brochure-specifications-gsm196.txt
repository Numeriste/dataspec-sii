The GSMI 96 monitors the (E)GSM900,
GSMI 800 and WCDMAIUMTS 21OO(3G)
bands. It is designed to detect the
presence of unauthorised mobile
phones and then help locate them.
In the Handheld mode, a 9-LED signal
level display shows the strongest
signal detected and helps to guide
the operator to i t s source.This eases
searching where several signals may
be present. A cadenced vibrator
(switchable) allows for covert use.
In the Static mode, alarms are
latched so that the unit can be left
unattended, for example overnight,
allowing later analysis.
In both modes, the unit distinguishes
between Network signals (text messages
and registrations), GSM calls, and 3G
calls, and indicates both current and past
alarms separately for each type.
Two sensitivity ranges are provided.
These are optimised for detection at a
distance and location at closer ranges.
For situations where greater accuracy
is required and /or specific monitoring
is required in areas containing multiple
phones, a specially designed directional
antenna (SA918) can be used with the
GSMI 96 & GSMI 96A.
The GSMI 96A is set-up to the USA,
Mexican and South American networks.
This device monitors the GSM850,
GSMI900, and WCDMA2100 (3G) bands. D

The 196 and 196A only detects handset frequencies (uplink).In this way the unit does
not react to nearby Base Station signals.
