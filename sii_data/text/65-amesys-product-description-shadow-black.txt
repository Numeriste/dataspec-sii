OUR BUSINESS
Amesys is a French company part of Bull group,
leader in high technology critical systems and
security since 1979.
Its core business is to supply world class expertise in
EW and INTEL systems for military and government
agencies. backed by recognized engineering knowhow and a proven ability to innovate.
Amesys is setting new standards by introducing its
intelligent jamming solution SHADOW.
This unique product range shifts protection and
communication jamming efficiency to a level never
reached before.
This technology is the result of several years of
experience on integration and active jammers
countering RC-IED. Amesys has changed the
philosophy and concepts of jamming in order to
cover all the limitations of existing active high power
systems.

SHADOW has been designed for armed forces
nations but also for domestic security needs.
SHAOOW systems are suitable for many operational
roles such as :
" QRoad side bombs" protection for vehicles
[individual or convoy). dismounted personnel
and VIP operations.
" Stationing forces or critical area protection.
" Identifying enemy communications and engaging
them.
" Explosive Ordnance Disposal [EDD) operations
protection.
" Radio communications control.

ONE TECHNOLOGY
SHADOW 1s an Intelligent or Smart
reactive Jammer, which means :
" it jams only when necessary,
" It guarantees a permanent surveillance

of the complete spectrum,
" 1t 1ams automatically with an optimized
countermeasure and reactivity adapted
to the targeted communication,
" 1t saves power for others potential
threats and can engage a large number
of communications at a same time for
urban use,

" It reduces people exposure to radiation.

This unique technology allows using this platform
for several applications with adapted configurations
such as dedicated antennas, power amplifiers or
specific graphical user interfaces...

INTEGRATION
Mobile installation
Shadow can be installed easily on many
types of vehicles for convoy protection or
jamming capacity projection
It 1s power supplied by power generators
or extra alternators added to the vehicles
and combined with batteries.
The command/ control of the system is
done using the remote control on the
dashboard dunng high speed off road •
driving or with the back seats' workstation.
Each installatmn 1s fitted with Integrated
Built In Test and automatic failure mode
management to ensure the m1ss1on.
Options can be added such as telescopic
mast with high gain directive antennas to
extend the range or CCTV features

Fixed installation
SHADOW can be installed outdoors and indoors to
protect a critical facility or area.
A dedicated lightweight structure integrates
the cases on trays and the antennas system. The
jammer can also be integrated and masked inside
buildings for permanent use.
The system is remotely controlled with Ethernet
link. It can also be :
" Stand alone or AC connection power supplied
" Connected with additionnal antennas to extend
protection coverage to several rooms
" Networked with other Shadow products to
cover large areas.
