The EKI 1601 is a vehicle mounted very
high power jammer designed for blocking remote controlled improvised
explosive devices Used by terrorist. The EKj 1601 is using state-of-art technology
for maximum performance and jamming the signals transmits to activate bombs.
The unit controlled by Microprocessor for PLL programming and use unique
modulation technique based on mixed signal for maximum jamming efficiency.
Each module of EKj 1601 transmits unique noise signal which create "firewall"
between the transmitter and its receiver.
The jamming signal is being generated by Multi-VCO chain which results very
high sweeping time along the bands hence create high RF density in each part of
protected frequency band.
Jamming radius of EKj 1601 depends on several conditions such a cells
transmitter frequency and output power, distance to receiver and obstacles
between. System modularity allows flexible usage in different applications.
System Features
Systems have 3 modes of operation:
1. Sweep Mode - jamming the whole frequency band at an ultra-fast Speed
continuous sweeping.
2. Spot Mode - jamming 4 frequencies from list of 10 pre-programmed.
3. Open Communication Window - Allows open communication from 6 preprogrammed options. Thus frequencies can be changed in factory when
customer needs.
- Designed to block wireless communication including
HF, VHF, UHF, SHE', Cellular Networks, Satellite
Phones, GPS etc.
- Output power up to 187W and 150W per band
- Modules of jammer operates separated;

Facility and Personal Protection

EKDED 2303 - Personal Scanning
The screening system currently in use
involving metal detectors, undressing, and
gentle prowling is inefficient. What is more, it
is humiliating and fatiguing also requiring a
lot of personnel to be involved yet keeping
the passenger throughput low. These
shortcomings are particularly apparent at
countries of "moderate" climate where
people are dressed and shod warm.
Now the problem has grown into an urgent
one calling for radical changes in the existing
system of screening. The goal of screening is
to detect any suspicious objects (including
non-metal ones) or substances the
possession of which is prohibited by law
making one try to hide them somewhere in
his/her clothes, footwear, on or inside the
body. Special case screening of those who
wear prosthesis, plaster, etc., is also
desirable.
Screeners based on penetrating Roentgen
radiation keeping a person under screening
away from any undressing also allowing an
"easy standing" posture. Besides, there are no
parts hidden to inspection even inside the
body.
Meanwhile the devices are quite definitely to
be the only solution capable of ensuring
efficient and convenient screening. The
challenge of applicability is in making the
dose of radiation negligibly small even in
comparison with the natural radiation
background. In other words, possibility of
super-low-dose examination is the key to a
large-scale application of the X-ray screeners.

Theory of Operation
The System is a multifunctional Electronic Perimeter Security system. Employing
state of the art vibration sensors installed on the fence perimeter, the system
monitors and displays intrusion attempts with high degrees of accuracy with low
false alarm rates. Intrusion attempts are displayed on a computer monitoring the
Control Center. The systems vibration sensors are based on the Time Domain
Reflectometer principle (TDR), which displays attempts at penetrating the fence
perimeter with an accuracy of -HO meters.
