Key Functionality

The system is a completely secure, self contained
GPS/GSM tracking and monitoring system. It is •
capable of tracking persons, objects, vehicles, in
fact any mobile asset, "anywhere" in the world, •
within GSM coverage .
The CP2 system communicates with a deployed •
object via the GSM network either via GPRS, GSM
data or SMS (Text Message). The system can ask •
where that object is and automatically place it on
a map within a few meters accuracy.
CP2 provides the ability to configure the deployed •
object to carry out functions remotely, whether
that is periodically reporting position or to report •
when movement has commenced or stopped.

Map Engine

The mapping application, HT-Viewer, is a
engine specifically engineered for
applications. This enables the use of
data from multiple sources in multiple
furthering the flexibility of the system.

formats,

The viewer provides two windows: a street level
tracking window, and an overview window. This is
essential for operations requiring monitoring of
more than one object. The overview window
provides an international (or national) view of all
active objects. By selecting a region of interest on
the overview, the user can zoom in to street level
detail in the sister window without relinquishing
overview information for all active objects.

Additionally, the use of map data (instead of closed •
mapping applications), provides for an international
theatre of operations, as current street level data is
available off the shelf for most countries. Since the
engine was designed for tracking operations, it •
efficiently processes large amounts of data providing
for fluid movement of the maps and objects. This
level of efficiency allows for the operation of the system in the field on laptops.
•
Multiple file/data formats can be integrated into one
data set, providing for their concurrent use. For
example, street level data and geo-referenced aerial
photography can be combined for use or customer •
specific or custom maps can be added.

•

Geo-Fencing

Geo-Fencing is enabled by electronically establishing
boundaries (a fence) around an area or an object.
This area can be as small as a house or as large as a •
country. The software can be configured to alert
upon entry and/or exit of the boundary by an •
enabled object. Our objects have the capability to
maintain multiple geo-fenced areas, allowing for •
route deviation monitoring etc.
Message Forwarding

The CP2 has the ability to forward messages to •
another set of software or via SMS to a mobile
phone. This will provide position, status and certain
alarm information to users without "actively" •
monitoring the software. Utilising SMS the CP2 can
also receive requests from authorised mobiles and
reply with the location and status of the selected •
object as a text message.
