Video Transmission System – HVTRX-410 PLL
Description
The video system is especially produced for movement operations to guarantee a stable quality in
video and audio transmission.
The components of the system allow a full operational capability on both the transmitting and receiving
side.
The HVTRX 410 PLL comprises the HVTX-410 PLL and a handheld LCD TV. The HVTX-410 PLL is a
miniature video transmitter with an audio channel. It is constructed using SMD technology and is fitted
with a highly-sensitive miniature electret microphone. Due to its PLL frequency editing the transmitter
has a high stability of frequency. It is possible to supply a camera with a power supply of 5 V DC
directly from the transmitter. Thus, the wiring expenditure is reduced. Thanks to its very small size and
weight, it is also suitable for wearing about the body for special unobtrusive applications or can be
concealed in a variety of items. The handheld LCD TV is used for portable applications. Thus, it may
be used as a concealed portable video/audio receiver without additional technical modification.
