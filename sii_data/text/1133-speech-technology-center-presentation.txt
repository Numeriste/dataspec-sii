Identifying music in a live
sound stream

Applications

Jingle Tracker captures the number and
time that jingles or music samples are
played on a given broadcasting channel.

Applications

! Advertising agencies: To identify the number of times
and when a promotion jingle plays back on a number
of broadcasting channels.
! Broadcasting & Music Copyright organisations: To
check how many times and when music plays back on
a number of broadcasting channels.

Structure
!

Implementing Music Spotting assumes two major
stages:

!

Creation of a database: In order to start using music
recognition a database of templates has to be
created. Here, two options are available:
1) manual -Template Maker software;
2) automatic (available in SDK only)

!

Identification: The recognition server software logs
any occurrence of the data included in the database.

Advantages

!

Analysis in real-time provides instant identification
in a live broadcast;

!

Low-resource consumption – runs on standard
personal computers (PC);

!

Adjusting accuracy and performance provides easy
adaptation for different tasks

Template maker
Template Maker is a convenient tool used to create a
database of templates from a number of desired
musical/advertisement samples
The database should be created before the
recognition can be initiated.

The additional information for any
record can be specified, such as:
- Template ID, Title, Owner’s ID,
Publisher’s ID, Time, Date, etc.

Recognition server
Recognition server is the core application to analyze
live sound stream, recognize musical fragments and
to perform reporting.
The software provides successful recognition of
about 1,500 x 1 minute templates running on
Pentium IV 1.5GHz system
One server application is capable to
perform recognition for one
channel per single CPU.

Developer’s kit
Music recognition library will allow Windows developers
to create sophisticated and customized applications
based on STC technology.
Music Spotting SDK features:
- More flexibility in delivering extra features apart from
Jingle Tracker application;
- Automatic creation of the templates;
- Analysis by processing a prerecorded stream;
The development version includes demo software.
Flexible licensing policy.
