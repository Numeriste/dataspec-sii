The INCA Repeater is a four channel, up t o five watts remote
controllable analogue RF repeater, which can receive a signal
from an INCA transmitter and repeat at high power t o an INCA
Streetfighter. The Repeater allows the use of small, low power
transmitters at the target, thereby giving extended battery life
and extended operating range.
The Repeater works with all INCA transmitters and can work in
three different modes:
Repeater mode
Receiver mode
Transmitter mode

RepeaterThe Repeater receives a RF signal from an analogue
transmitter and retransmits it t o a receiver. It is possible t o
select between one of four channels pairs and one o f four
power levels. The Repeater or target transmitter can be
remote controlled from an X-IDER 4096 remote control and
an INCA GM Keyfob
Receiver Mode
The Repeater acts as a RF receiver. The received signal can
be recorded through the Line Out or listened t o by means of
the headphone connector. I n receiver mode, the transmitting
part of the repeater is turned off, thereby saving power.

TfanmmMMode

transmitter. It is possible to connect a standard line level
audio signal to the LINE connector or t o connect an external
microphone t o the MIC IN connector. I n transmitter mode,
the receiving part of the repeater is turned off, thereby saving
