Introduction

The need for Data Retention
European legislation requires CSPs to retain data.
Retained data spans multiple domains: traffic data, customer
data, location data.
Retained data can span multiple type of networks.
Access to the retained data is restricted.
LEA requests must be serviced quickly, even for 8old9 data.

globalsafe)ynee,sglobalreliabili)y

EU Directive
Data for identifying the following aspects has to
be retained for a period of 6 to 24 months:
the source of a communication,
the destination of a communication,
the date, time and duration of a communication,
the type of communication,
the user9s communication equipment or what purports to be 
their equipment, and
the location of mobile communication equipment.

Handover Interface ! request
A requests contains of:
digital Signature (optional, for validation purposes),
CSP-ID as assigned to the Operator,
request-ID,
retained data category (e.g. subscriber data, usage data, etc.),
a set of identifications of the retained data subject (e.g., phone
number, name, address, IMSI, time stamp or time window etc.),
requested period.

DR life-cycle
The processes involved in Data Retention
can be summarized as follows:

collect the data to be retained,
prepare the data for storage,
store the data in a searchable way,
manage LEAs and execute requests for Retained Data,
retrieve the information from the Retained Data Store,
hand-over the requested Retained Data to the LEA9s premises, and
destroy the data when the retention period elapses.

Preparation gives additional assurance that the right amount of
data is retained and that the data meets the expected quality.

Challenges

globalsafe)ynee,sglobalreliabili)y

Challenges
Millions of CDRs per day
(dependent on CSP size and network type)

Retention period of 6 months to 2 years or more
Storage range approximately 10 ! 100 TByte
Compact storage systems of 48TByte in 4U height available today

globalsafe)ynee,sglobalreliabili)y

Organizational Impact
Many requests for RD are expected
Security budgets are typically not increased
A high level of automation for handling RD
requests is needed
Single user interface for LI and DR is an
advantage

More automation means less manpowerC

globalsafe)ynee,sglobalreliabili)y

Collection Phase
Deployment is non-standard
Each CSP has its own mix of Network Elements
Transport of information to RD site

Various sources of information need to be integrated in the total
DR infrastructure
Dedicated conversions might be needed

globalsafe)ynee,sglobalreliabili)y

Normalization Phase
Data retrieved from various NEs tend to have
different formats.
Typically, only a subset of the information of a
CDR has to be retained.
Normalizing the data leads to:
Uniform data
Less data

globalsafe)ynee,sglobalreliabili)y

Retention Phase
Approach to Storage
Relational database E ‘heavy’ weight
Object database E does not perform well
Indexed files E ‘light’ weight

Huge amounts of information
Scaling to hundreds of TByte
Redundancy
Back-up facilities

globalsafe)ynee,sglobalreliabili)y

Retrieval & Handover
Finding a needle in a haystack
Efficient indexing many TBytes of data is challenging
Many indexing technologies need to re-arrange the index
regularly

Handover Interface
ETSI compliant
Support for country-specific extensions
Alternative interface (email, fax, CD/DVD)

globalsafe)ynee,sglobalreliabili)y

Conclusion ! Functionality
Implementing the complete life-cycle leads to:
High quality of the retained data
Highly automated processing of requests

Not implementing all phases leads to:
Lower quality of the retained data (calculated risk)
Manual handling of many (or all) requests

Conclusion ! Investments
"#$%&'($)*#+,)$-+./012+#%$,*'3+%45)67%#$
Storage capacity is relatively cheap
(less than F1000 / TByte)

Software licenses are largest price-component
Licensing can be based on:
CDRs / day
software usage
Number of subscribers
raises questions about transit-traffic and roaming subscribers
Stored CDRs
hardware usage

Maintenance & Support fees

LIMA Data Retention

globalsafe)ynee,sglobalreliabili)y

Facing the Obligation
Doing nothing is dangerous:
When a request for retained data is received, you need to
have information from the past!
GWait until requested and then actI is a high-risk attitude.
