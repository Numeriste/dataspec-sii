MELANIE
Speech Detection & Language Identification, SQ
Functionality
Speech
signals
are
often
recorded with pauses and noise
within the speech signal. This
algorithm is able to detect those
parts of a speech signal that contain speech on larger segments of audio signals.
The results are very useful to reduce the amount of data that have to be stored
and anaylsed.
Speech signals can be analysed according to the language prevailing in the speech.
For each speech signal, an overall score and
probability is estimated. In addition, these
values can also be estimated for any time
interval.

Training of Models
Goal

Training is performed in order to optimise the models on
the languages and channel of the application. Training

Data

The training data must be labeled according to either
speech/nonspeech or with the prevailing language. The
data must be representative and as similar as possible to
the data of the application. A minimum of one hour of data
is required for each language.

Trained Models

In case of insufficient data, trained models for a set of
languages can be provided to use the system from
scratch.

Technical Data
OperatingSystem
Processing Time

Recognition Rate

Available on Windows XP and Linux
• On a P4; 3GHz, 1GB RAM computer
• Classifying 10 different languages
• 1/15 of real time; i.e. a signal of 15 minutes length is
processed in one minute
The recognition rate depends on the number of languages,
on the similarities and charactistics of the languages, and
on the speech quality.

Consequently, this means that a recording with a signal length of 20
minutes can be fully classified in one minute.
