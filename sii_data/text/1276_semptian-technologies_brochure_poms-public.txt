database subsystem, analysis subsystem, application subsystem. The extraction subsystem put some
information into some area in the sub database system according to search words and core words. The
analysis subsystem analyzes the information in the analysis subsystem according to configuration. The
analysis subsystem puts data information back to another area in the database subsystem after it
analyzes and the application subsystem directly browses through information that the analysis
subsystem finishes analyzing.
