RМК 073 SPUTNIK
Crystal controlled audio transmitter
Features:
- Super compact (9 x 18 x 3 mm);
- High quality audio;
- Low power consumption;
- Wide range of power supply voltages;
- Variable output power;
- Crystal frequency control.
Overview:
The product designed, as an unpacked PCB sealed with protective compound is a universal module
rated for hidden installation. Up-to date components base and miniature crystal resonators made it
possible to create the transmitter module twice smaller then its previous version.
Any D.C. 3 - 6 V, 50 mA power supply is useful for the product including 3 V, 1,5 A/h. 90 × 60 × 3
mm. slim flexible lithium cells.
Unpackaged Sputnik equipped with remote microphone, flexible antenna, power supply connection
leads is rated for it's further camouflaging (hidden installation) in various objects.
Available camouflage solutions:
- Pieces of clothing and footwear;
- Jewelry and accessories;
- Pieces of interior and furniture;
- Room finishing materials;
- Home electric appliances and electronics;
- Items of packaging;
- Communications means.
Time of continuous operation of the product powered from one lithium cell is 5 days. In
combination with lithium cell the product suits installation in articles of clothing. Application of
different power supply voltages provides variable output power of the product within 10 - 30 mW
limits.

Directions for use:
It is recommended to integrate the product inside dielectric camouflage substances with low RF
absorption ratio. Allocation of the product above metal surfaces can decrease radiation efficiency of
the product. While selecting a power supply source please take into account the data-sheet current
value of the power source, which should be not less than the consumption current of the product.
Caution!
The product is not protected against reversed polarity.
