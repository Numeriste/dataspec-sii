LabSat is the revolutionary new product from GPS experts

RACELOGIC.

As one of the first dedicated GPS Simulators with RF record and playbackfacilities, LabSat enables real world GPS
testing to take place in the laboratory.
LabSat is small and rugged, allowing it to be used in the field to continuously record the RF GPS signal in a digital
form that can then be replayed at a later date. As LabSat records real world GPS data, this means that all GPS
artefacts are faithfully re-produced on the bench. Multipath, ionospheric effects and dropouts can now be recorded
and then reproduced with ease. LabSat works with the L1 (1575.42MHz) signal and has no limit on the number of
satellites that can be logged.

To cover all testing requirements, scenarios can also be generated from scratch using the SotGen software, which
can provide simulated data to specific requirements. Playback with Racelogic prepared scenarios is also possible.

How does it work?
LabSat is controlled by a PC using a high speed USB 2.0 link. When recording RF GPS data, LabSat is connected to a
laptop and data is continuously streamed to the hard disk. Approximately 1GB of data is stored for every 10 minutes
of use, with no limit on the length of the sample. When replaying, the same data is streamed from the laptop to
LabSat at the same rate. A large internal buffer means that data is seamlessly replayed.

How is it used?
LabSat is ideal for almost any kind of GPS development. It is used to test and develop GPS engines, GPS enabled
smartphones, Portable Navigation Devices, GPS tracking systems and much more. It is very well suited to end of line
testing as it can represent a real world test as well as a carefully simulated scenario. In addition, LabSat can be used
to calibrate GPS products, such as the Racelogic VBOX range.
