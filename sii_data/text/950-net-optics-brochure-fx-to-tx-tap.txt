FX to TX Tap
Net Optics FX to TX Tap simplifies connecting GigaBit copper monitoring and security
devices to FX fiber network links. Convert FX to TX and tap into the link with one
device, reducing cost and complexity at the same time. FX to TX Taps support passive
monitoring of links at speeds at 100 Mbps.
The FX to TX Taps establish permanent passive access ports without introducing a
point of failure or disturbing other network connections. Without an IP address,
monitoring devices are isolated from the network, dramatically reducing their exposure
to attacks. However, the monitoring device connected to the Tap still sees all
full-duplex traffic, including Layer 1 and Layer 2 errors.

For extra uptime protection, Net Optics FX to TX Taps offer redundant power
connections. Should the primary power source fail, the Tap automatically switches to
the backup power source. All network and monitoring cables necessary for
plug-and-play deployment are included.

Passive, Secure Technology
