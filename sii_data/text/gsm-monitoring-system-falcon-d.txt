GSM Monitoring System: FALCON D+
Description
The Falcon D+ system is designed for surveillance tasks and monitoring of telephone
conversations within the GSM 900/1800 networks. The system provides the option of
both stationary and mobile operation.

• The system ensures monitoring of audio and data traffic within standard GSM
900/1800 networks:
• Without application of encryption algorithms
• Application of encryption algorithm A5/2 [real-time] (decoding time: 0.01 sec.)
• Application of encryption algorithm A5/1 [real-time] when Ki is known
• Default configuration of the system - 8 reception channels
• The system ensures registration of radio-electronic circumstances within the radio
cells to be monitored (frequency and characteristics of BCCH-channels)
• Channels which are to be monitored are, according to the task, manually selected by
the user.
• The system contains a database (up to 100,000 calling partners), operating in realtime, which can be accessed corresponding to the selected search criteria and parameters.
• Calling partners are identified according to the IMEISV, IMSI, TMSI, ISDN number
(local and international number)
• Assessment of presence of calling partners to be monitored and identification of
specific parameters (TMSI) occurs automatically by means of a mobile phone with
special software. The special software is contained in the scope of delivery.
• Registration and storage of telephone conversations occur on the system’s hard
disk.
• The system ensures registration and storage as audio codec - types FR, EFR, HR.
• Playback of recordings may be carried out by the system itself (CoolEdit-Software).
• Identification of SMS and DTMF data.
• Systems’s coverage:
• Down-Link - up to 10 km
• Up-Link - up to 500m in city
• Assessment of coverage between calling partner and base station; accuracy of up to
550m
The system has a TCP/IP interface which ensures that several devices can be
remote controlled in the same network (LAN, DSL, etc.)
