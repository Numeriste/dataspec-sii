ARREST IN DRUGS IMPORTATION
UK - Interception of a highly professional
international group involved in trafficking
Class A drugs revealed the intention to
import a large consignment. As the plan
developed it identified individuals recruited
to transport and receive the drugs. The
intercepted calls were in coded language
which could have been attributed to
legitimate activity. The group evidently
had a lot of knowledge of covert
techniques, but not enough understanding
of how they are used to provide effective
security. Continued interception revealed
new timings for the importation and travel
arrangements for those involved. This
enabled officers to observe the collection
of the drugs, arrest two of the
principals, and seize 20 kilograms of
heroin, over 20 firearms, and over 1000
rounds of ammunition.

Kidnap over a debt
Interception confirmed
that the hostage was
alive
Arrest of all involved
and recovery of the
ransom

ARREST IN KIDNAP
UK- In 2007 a person contacted
police reporting the kidnap of a
friend over a debt. A third party was
apparently negotiating in isolation
and refusing to cooperate with the
police. A further party was also
negotiating without cooperating fully
with the police. The situation was
further complicated by direction from
members of the criminal group
abroad. Interception over several
days confirmed that the hostage,
although injured, was alive. It
allowed police to control the
developing situation to the point
where a significant sum of money
was paid and the hostage released.
This triggered the arrest of all
involved in the kidnap, and the
recovery of the ransom.

NO LEAD IN EXTORTION
NL - There was a case of
extortion, where the
criminals used a foreign
free e-mail address.
The police wanted to
intercept the e-mails in
which the criminals
asked for the random,
but they encountered
two problems:
1.
Legal problem: The
police needs to
intercept persons, not
IP-addresses, so first
the person need to be
known.
2.
Technical problem: In
order to intercept the email you need to
intercept the backbone
-> how do you find the
specific e-mail in all the
traffic?

NL - Intercepted IP files are
delivered to the LEMF as ZIP

sufficient, consequently the
compressed file cannot be

Addressing the Issues

Technical Issue
LI: the bigger picture | 2009 | Slide 11

!

VoIP interception: CSPs have packet switched, and
LEMF asks for circuit-switched delivery.

!

Consequences:
:;<&.%3&12&*+=$31&*+&>2#/?&1$@.+2#2)0A

!

Specification issues
LI: the bigger picture | 2009 | Slide 12

!

Specification is issued, and solution is developed
afterwards.

!

Consequences:
When a warrant is issued, CSPs cannot react
immediately.

!

Legal Issues
LI: the bigger picture | 2009 | Slide 13

!

CSPs are waiting for the law to be enforced.

!

Consequences:
CSPs are not ready when a warrant for interception
is granted.

Operational Issues
LI: the bigger picture | 2009 | Slide 14

!

CSP is ready for the connection to the LEMF
monitoring centre, but the LEMF has not installed
their monitoring facilities.

!

Consequences:
Intercepted traffic cannot be delivered to the LEMF
and has therefore no value.

Addressing the issues

Errors
LI: the bigger picture | 2009 | Slide 17

!

Where people work, mistakes are made.

!

Consequences:
Entering the wrong number or date lead to no
interception of the suspect or the intercepted data is
not valid in court.

!

Technical Developments
LI: the bigger picture | 2009 | Slide 18

!

In the world of telecom, technology used today is out
tomorrow. E.g. changing from radius to DHCP server.

!

Consequences:
LI solution needs to be adaptable to network
changes, so there are no consequences for an
current interception.

!

Specification Developments
LI: the bigger picture | 2009 | Slide 19

!

As technology develops, specifications develop as
well. ETSI has published new versions for ETSI 232.

!

Consequences:
LI solution needs to be adaptable to specification
changes, so there are no consequences for an
current interception.

!

Legal Developments
LI: the bigger picture | 2009 | Slide 20

!

Data Retention is the latest legal development in
many countries. Integration of the DR solution with
existing LI solutions, can save you a lot of time and
money.

!

Consequences:
Not being able to integrate new legal demands into
your system, will mean that you need to start at the
beginning with each new law.

!

Operational Developments
LI: the bigger picture | 2009 | Slide 21

!

Is your system ready for updates? Software updates
can sometimes compromise a current interception.

!

Consequences:
The interception is deleted or changed and therefore
cannot be used to intercept suspects or cannot be
used as evidence in court.

!

Solving the issues
LI: the bigger picture | 2009 | Slide 22

!
!

Errors
Automatisation of processes, you only need to enter
the warrant and the solution takes care of the
provisioning systems.
Developments
Modular and flexible solution, adaptable to new
requirements.

Conclusion

The Bigger Picture
LI: the bigger picture | 2009 | Slide 24

!
!

!

There is a lot going on in Lawful Interception.
Authorities are struggling to keep up with technical
developments, but by cooperating with CSPs the
struggle can be overcome.
Operators are reluctant to invest in LI, but there is no
escape. However, cooperation with the authorities
can save time and money.

How do you solve these issues?
