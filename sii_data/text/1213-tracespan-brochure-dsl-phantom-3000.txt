DSL Phantom rM
TraceSpan ™ has leveraged patent-pending technology to provide innovative and unique solutions for the monitoring and recording
of data across ADSL broadband networks. The Company's flagship product, DSL Xpert TM, has broken new ground as the first nonintrusive performance-analysis solution for ADSL networks. Empowered by host-based signal processing. DSL Xpert TM monitors the
transfer of all data between the central office (CO) and customer premise equipment (CPE).
By further leveraging of our core technology. TraceSpan has developed the DSL Phantom TM Lawful Interception (LI) monitoring
solution. DSL Phantom TM is a monitoring device that records and stores broadband digital information, offering unique advantages
for Law Enforcement Authorities (LEA) looking to capture any data between the central office and the target.

DSL Phantom TM operates on a powerful platform that supports high bit rates, enabling it to monitor information more effectively.
DSL Phantom TM can be installed at virtually any location (Central Office or Street). while the data can be monitored at a remote
location. DSL Phantom™ is completely non-intrusive, allowing the law enforcement agency to monitor information without being
detected.
