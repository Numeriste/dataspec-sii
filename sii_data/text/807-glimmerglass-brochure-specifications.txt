DATASHEET

The Giimmerglass Intelligent
Optical system ioo
Industry Leading Capabilities
• Industrys most compact I highest port density
photonic cross-connect

System jOO

• B i t rate independent - supports all optical data
rates including 100 Gb's

16.16- 96.96

• Protocol and format independent, compatible with
soNETssDH. Ethernet, CIDWDM, Video, FC,
FICON. E s C O N , and all others
• Matrix size 16x16 to 96x96 fiber ports

Intelligent Optical signal Management

• Asymmetric configurations

The Glimmerglass Intelligent Optical system 100 revolutionizes optical signal

• 2 0 millisecond switching

management by enabling network operators to rapidly and remotely access, distribute

• Ultra-low power consumption < 5 0 Watts

and monitor optical signals and create and reconfigure optical paths in real time.

• supports dark and very low power connections

Advanced management software combined with purely optical photonic cross-

• Single mode fiber, widebarid (1270 nm - 1630 nm)

connects provide remote operators with superior visibility and control of optical signals.

Easy to Manage and Use

Intelligent Optical systems provide transparent signal access and are key enablers

• 5NМР3

of the Glimmerglass CyberSweep"A. Their unique capabilities enable the dynamic

• Web-based user interface

selection and distribution of optical signals for analysis and storage.

• Import and export topologies
• Command-Line Interface (TL1)

Glimmerglass optical systems enable operators to:
• Access and monitor optical signals in real time without disrupting traffic

Powerful Carrier-Class Design

• Remotely create and reconfigure optical signal paths in milliseconds

• Delivers 99999+% availability

• Handle any data rate, any protocol and any format including DWDM

• In-service software upgrades

• Select, duplicate, and distribute optical signals to one or many locations
• Continuously monitor signals and remotely test and diagnose optical paths

Outstanding Reliability
• M T B F З О years
• Dual -48V DC or redundant, hot-swappable AC
power option

Create
Glimmerglass systems provide a fully non-blocking, transparent cross-connect, In
milliseconds an optical path can be created between any fiber input and Output, since
the technology is fully transparent, the newly created optical path will transport any

Advanced Optical signal Management

signal regardless of data format or speed.

• Threshold crossing alerts

Monitor

• Protection switching rules

Continuous optical power monitoring combined with transparent switching forms a

• Photonic multicastirig for connecting point to

superior solution for remotely monitoring network paths and performing diagnostics.

• Dedicated or switched Variable Optical
Attenuation (VOA) to control output power levels

piece of equipment

• Virtual Private switch (VPS) allows administrators
to partition ports for individual user access
• Bidirectional operation

Loopback paths may be created in milliseconds to help isolate a fault to a particular

Reconfigure
Glimmerglass systems are the ideal solution for remotely adding, reconfiguring, and
disconnecting optical paths on demand and making system level topology changes.
