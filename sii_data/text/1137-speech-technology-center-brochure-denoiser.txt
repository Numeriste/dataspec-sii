DENOISER CLEAR VOICE
Noise Filtration DSP Board
Technical Features

Overview
Denoiser Clear Voice automatically removes noise
and keeps the useful signal clear and undistorted. It
effectively filters out noise generated by air
conditioners, street traffic, wind, the power supply
hum, engine rumbling, channel interference,
atmospheric noise and many other types of
background noise. Denoiser Clear Voice dramatically
increases speech intelligibility in enabled
applications.
