TSE 7503 Cable Checker
The Cable-Checker System detects parallel or serial connected transmission or storage bugs tapping a
communication line. It makes it possible to verify the following eavesdropping methods:
Line information scanning
Transmission of stored data
Usage of the power supply

Usage
The supplied cables and accessories ensure the
connection of the Cable-Checker System to all lines
to be analyzed in any possible situation, thus allowing
any wire circuits to be scanned whatever their function.
State-run enterprises, organizations, services and
professional Sweep Teams are able to do a reliable
analysis of a conspicuous line and its type of
construction in a very short time.

Features
Detection of illegal wire tapping of all kinds of cables
Examination of non-linear changes of transferred signals
Automatic measurement of different line parameters
Detection of electric current leakage
Verification of the isolation resistance
Optical indicator panels:
LCD-Display
Double-LED-Chain
Single LEDs
Pan-stand
