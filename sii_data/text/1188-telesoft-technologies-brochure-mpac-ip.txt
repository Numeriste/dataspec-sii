The MPAC-IP 4975 Ethernet Monitoring Card is a network access, filtering and
monitoring board for high rate Ethernet data networks. The board provides a 10Gb
Ethernet monitoring input, three Gigabit Ethernet ports for the direct delivery of
filtered data and FPGA based layer 2-4 packet filtering.
Integrated filtering identifies each individual flow (n-tuple filtering) and discards unwanted
packets. Selected flows can be further filtered with libpcap based Berkley Packet Filters (BPF).
Classification functions provide the next stage of Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) with instant
access to protocol layer boundaries and variable position text, accelerating the DPI function
and off-loading processing from the host.
Filtered frames being forwarded can either be copied directly to host memory or forwarded
to a remote server via the onboard dual Gigabit Ethernet ports. The line-speed filtering makes
the IPAC card suitable for real-time or post analysis packet processing applications.
Direct forwarding of filtered packets over Ethernet removes the need for host processing of
some (or even all) data. For example a voice over IP monitoring product may use the card to
deliver signalling protocols (such as SIP or H.323) over the PCIe bus, while delivering voice
content (such as RTP) directly over Ethernet to a recorder or playback system.
