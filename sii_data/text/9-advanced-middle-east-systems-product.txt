The ALPHA passive off the air GSM interception unit is able to intercept the communications between
the handset and the BTS. It is a WIDE BAND (processing the whole GSM bands) and PASSIVE solution,
meaning that absolutely nothing is sent to intercept. It makes this solution completely undetectable
by the targets or the operators unlike active interception solutions in the markets.
Thanks to its dense FPGA architecture, this solution is able to intercept up to 60000 communications
per hour, which enables this solution to be suited for MASSIVE application (border control for example), the ALPHA PA is able to demodulate and decipher in REAL TIME up to 320 duplex communication.
Two versions are available either in a 2U format for low cost application (up to 20 full duplex simultaneous communication) or in a 3U format to get the fu ll power of the systems.
The front end can be connected to the deciphering box (Beta2) through Ethernet connection using
either Vsat, 3G or cable links. In the case of a powerful deciphering box, multiple front ends can be
connected.
