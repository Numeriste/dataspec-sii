XDataNet
What is XDataNet?
XDataNet offers leading edge database techniques that provide a superb solution
for long term data archiving and fast data retrieval capability.
XDataNet is a sophisticated data warehouse and mining solution that decodes,
monitors and stores live data records. The system connects to real time data
sources using secure TCP/IP connection over wide area networks. In doing so,
it receives binary data, decodes the specified fields before inserting them into a
central database for later analysis.
The system is capable of holding multi-billions of records over terabytes of RAID
configured fibre channel (FC) arrays.

Who uses XDataNet?
Information is a precious asset. Many organisations have an essential
requirement to retrieve, protect and manage high volumes of strategic data.
XDataNet provides an ideal data management solution for organisations such
as Emergency Services, Law Enforcement, Traffic Management, Banking, Utility
Companies, Government and many Private Sector businesses.

How does XDataNet work?
Real time data is collected from distributed data centers and fed to XDataNet
for storage and analysis. The stored data is analysed and reported by using a web
based software application running on a UNIX based Apache platform.
A user friendly interface allows various field search options over text, numbers,
date and time. Each entry can be marked and notes can be posted to other system
users during data analysis. User defined content filters limit data insertion and
partitions certain fields to offer ‘extra fast’ search capability.

Why buy XDataNet?
1.Expandable and Flexible Architecture :
XDataNet is based on a flexible architecture that is totally independent of your
software environment. This means that your XDataNet solution is easily expandable
should there be a need to manage increasing volumes of data. To accommodate
expansion, additional database servers and storage arrays can be integrated to
the system with minimum disruption. ‘Server load balancing’ and ‘data partitioning’
guarantees continued and stable system operation.
2. Multilingual Data Entry and Operation :
In order to accommodate globally dispersed or multicultural operations,
XDataNet supports multilingual data entry and display schemes. This means the
user interface language is determined when logging on to the system dependent
upon your chosen language settings.
3. Integrated System Audits :
To increase operational efficiency and prevent unauthorised system access,
each user activity session is logged and stored in the database. When logging on,
system administrators and individual users can view their activity logs, together with
any sent and received notes via a user portal.
4. Built-in Workflow :
A group formation structure allows the system administrator to define the
hierarchical work flow of an organization. This means individual user accounts and
access privileges are configurable to facilitate maximum operational flexibility and
security.
5. Web based Application Software :
XDataNet is a web based application that is deployed instantly and economically.
No client software is needed for operator terminals and the system can be accessed
from anywhere in the world using standard PC. In addition, just a low level of centrally
controlled on-going maintenance is required to keep the system running efficiently.
6. Outstanding Search Performance :
XDataNet search capability is based on a uniquely intuitive concept that facilitates
‘clever links’ within the data fields that significantly enhance the operator’s search
capabilities. This means search and data retrieval routines can be rapidly set-up
and carried out by the user.
7. Easy Integration :
Because XDataNet is web based and system settings are based on XML
parameters, it is easily integrated to any existing IT environment. This makes
implementation painless as well as economical.
