The
Infiltrator
Real-Time
Tracking System is an innovative
tool for governmental and security
organizations that require real-time
data about suspects’ location and
movement.
The combination of the Infiltrator
Real-Time Tracking System as a
strategic location solution and the
Intelligence Interceptor, a tactical
interception and location system,
provides accurate, real-time data of
target suspects and people of
interest by tracking their mobile
phones.

Real-Time

location (GPS coordination) at a Cell-ID level. The input will be the target mobile number or the IMSI and the result will show the
BTS coordination, where the target is registered on any map.
