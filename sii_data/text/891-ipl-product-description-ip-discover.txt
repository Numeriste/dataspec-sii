IP Discover - Transforming
Unstructured Data into Useful,

Social media content is often described as
unstructured data. It is unstructured because the
original structure of the posting or blog, e.g. the
subject and meaning, is only obvious to the author or
the participants in a soc ial media thread.
To derive the original structure requires careful humanbased analysis. This analysis is time-consuming and
potentially error-prone; issues that are compounded by the
sheer volume of social media content produced every second
of every day.
It is obvious that organisations wishing to extract maximum value
from social media content need automated solutions, ones that can be
trusted to process the massive quantity of information without making
mistakes.

IP Discover - Appropriate Architecture
Handling and storing the knowledge in an efficient, logical and secure manner is essential to the ways in which it can be analysed.
Social media content is inherently connected through different types of relationships, and it is by further analysing these complex links
that new and refined knowledge can be attained.
Therefore, careful consideration of the type of database selected to store and process the data is required.
Performance, scalability and an ability to manage ad hoc data are key. These factors must also be combined with the desire to identify
links and patterns.

For an organisation to take full advantage of knowledge, it often requires detailed analysis.
Doing so reveals hidden details, trends, patterns and relationships that 1nay not be initially apparent. Transforming knowledge into
relevant and usable intelligence helps an organisation's decision-maker decide on what to do next.

Identification of Hidden
Relationships
Social media content provides network information comprising
details of people and the links between them. If the incoming
datasets contain identifiable people, then analysis of the
social networks around events and individuals must be
possible.
Mathematical techniques can be used to explore hidden
relationships behind groups of people by identifying
significant connections, trends and patterns. This could,
in turn, result in an individual's influence within the
network being revealed.

Geographic Analysis
Public demonstrations are often associated with movement. The
route may be pre-planned and fixed, or as in the 2011 summer
riots, constantly changing and hence presenting a difficult
challenge for tlie police to monitor.
Group movements and trends detected during a live event can be
derived by analysing geographically tagged social media data.

Derived Intelligence
To help decision-makers respond quickly to incidents
or events, they can't be overwhelmed by detail. Derived
intelligence needs to be presented in appropriate, customisable
and useful ways.
Locations of individuals, groups or niches, and tracking their
movements, are obvious candidates for geospatial visualisation
using specialist mappin~ tools. Helping you understand the
identity of an individual, quickly, on a map, however complex the
network.
