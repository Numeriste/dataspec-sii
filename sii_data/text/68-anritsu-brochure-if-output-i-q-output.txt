Handheld IF Output
IF Output for Spectrum Master MS2723B/4B
IF Output Option
The IF Output option allows a signal to be
processed in the IF rather than using the standard
processing provided in the instrument.
Option 89 provides an IF signal at a center
frequency of 37.8 MHz out of a BNC female
connector when the instrument span is set to
zero.
The user can select the three fixed IF bandwidths shown below in addition to some extra
narrower bandwidths that are selected by using the RBW selection process. We expect
that most users will be interested in the widest bandwidth and will use the narrower
bandwidths infrequently, if at all. The output level of the IF signal is approximately
-25 dBm for a full-scale signal on the spectrum analyzer's display.
