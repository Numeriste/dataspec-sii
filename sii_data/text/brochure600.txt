NCW-1200
Network Centric Waveform (NCW)
1.2 Meter Flyaway Terminal
The NCW-1200 is a 1.2 meter Ku-band transportable SATCOM
At-The-Halt (ATH) transit-case terminal that provides NCW
tactical users with the specialized Internet Protocol (IP) communication capabilities to keep remote users connected where infrastructure is lacking (e.g. natural disasters, border surveillance and
tactical scenarios).
The NCW-1200 is comprised of three major transportable
components, a rack-mount Baseband Power Distribution (BPD)
transit-case, a Terminal Support Equipment (TSE) transit-case, and
an Antenna Pedestal Positioner (APP) transit-case. Together, these
transport components comprise a fully self-contained NCW
network asset that requires only external prime power (shore/vehicle
AC or vehicle DC) and a laptop PC for deployment.
The NCW-1200 is designed to operate at full capability over all
standard and extended Ku-band commercial satellites. By employing
the optional Ka-band kit, which is also stored in the TSE
transit-case, the terminal may be operated over the Wideband
Global SATCOM (WGS) Satellite. By employing this multi-band
capability on a common pedestal, the NCW-1200 terminal offers
greater world-wide deployment flexibility for both military and
commercial applications.
The standard terminal provides plug-and-play
NCW network operation with autoacquisition in the Ku-band. The
1.2 meter antenna also offers an
affordable and flexible VSAT
capability that provides enhanced performance when
throughput and portability
must be traded to optimize
mission requirements.
