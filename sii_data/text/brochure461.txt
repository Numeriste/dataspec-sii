Inattended ground sensors have been used for years as
force protection assets and for monitoring remote borders.
Typical applications included:

nattended ground sensors were originally designed

required a response. Even these simple missions required sensor
systems with different attributes. For some applications, lifetimes
30 days were sufficient, while monitoring remote,

ission range requirements were also applicationcific. Force protection systems typically required ranges of
than one kilomelter, while most border applicatians require

pictures of the targets. For example, a border guard may decide
that two people illegally crossing the border is a low-priority event
when he is also expecting a major drug shipment to occur soon. A
picture from a remote sensor can provide the information required
to differentiate one activity from another.
Federal agencies or security forces also may need to obtain
evidence to combat illegal activities, and typically a picture is not
sufficient. For example, they may want to:

be difficult to transmit the data over long distances w i h u t the
use of masts and highly directional antennas. Harris solved this
problem by developing the RF-7400E-VP low-power Tactical
Video Processor, which performs video input digitization, frame
rate selection, and variable data compression. This capability
allows the operator trade off range, frame rate, and picture
quality depending on mission requirements, consistent with lo
power communicationsoperations. The Tactical Video Processor
functionality is embedded in the RF-74PnC-VGTactical Video

False and nuisance alarm performance makes the difference
?tweena security and surveillance system that is a force
multiplier and one that is a manpower-consuming distraction.
mstant investigation of nuisance alarms will drain resources
xn the unit's primary mission and may eventually lead the
,dcurity team to retire the system altogether. Harris has included
various algorithms that minimize reports from a variety of typical
nuisance sources such as animals, high winds, low flying aircraft
and helicopters, artillery fire, etc. The U.S. Army Capabilities
Manager for Unattended Ground Sensors office praised our
sensors, noting that our false and nuisance alarm performance
should be the goal of every sensor vendor.
Today the commander often needs to be able to view a video of
detected targets to determine whether they are indeed threats.
The Security and Surveillance System toolbox provides a remote
video capability that can meet this requirement. Since video

Falcon C2View is used to display, store, and manage video
transmitted by the MicroTerrain Observation function. This software
also allows the operator to remotely modify the surveillance node
configuration parameters and camera presets. The emplacing team
can concentrate on positioning and camouflaging the surveillance
node, which is typically done at night; no time is wasted adjusting
settings and presets in the target area.
