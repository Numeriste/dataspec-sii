AN/PRD-13(V)2
Man Portable Signal Intelligence System
Linkabit’s AN/PRD-13(V)2 Man Portable Signals Intelligence (SIGINT)
System incorporates sophisticated RF intercept and Direction
Finding (DF) processing capabilities into a low power, lightweight, ruggedized, and reliable system that satisfies the most
demanding applications and mission requirements.
The AN/PRD-13(V)2 has been developed to support tactical SIGINT
missions by providing:
• Signal Environment Characterization
• Signal Exploitation
• Signal Location
• Threat Warning
The AN/PRD-13(V)2 contains a powerful signal
search capability that allows quick and accurate characterization of the signal
environment. The system can support directed search, general search, or a combination of
searches, providing the user greater flexibility.
For directed searches, the system allows the user to program a channel list of up to
400 normal plus 20 priority channels.
The system’s general search capability allows for the monitoring of up to 9 bands.
Three band search strategies are supported: automatic, semi-automatic, and new energy. In
addition, a frequency pass list of up to 400 signals can be maintained.
When signals are detected, the system can maintain an active signals list measuring
center frequency, bandwidth, time-first-seen, percent time active, DF bearing, and signal
strength. An optional recorder is available to record and playback intercepted audio and
signal parameters.

Man Portable Signal Intelligence System

The system has been optimized for the man portable tactical mission. The entire
system can be transported and operated by a single person, set-up in less than 5 minutes,
and weighs just 19.5 kg (43 lbs) including the MB-5700 NiCd Battery and all field
accessories. The system, cables, and components fit in a single pack and can be
parachute jumped in support of airborne operations.
Key system components include the:
• MD-405A Receiver/Processor
• MA-445C HF/VHF/UHF DF Antenna (2-2000 MHz)
• MA-715A HF/VHF/UHF Monitor Antenna (2-2000 MHz)
• MA-308 Handheld DF Antenna (2-500 MHz)
The heart of the AN/PRD-13(V)2 is the MD-405A Receiver/Processor. This unit
includes all system interfaces, three receivers, and dual microcontrollers, plus associated
display and man-machine interface (MMI) functions. The task-managed
MMI provides easy, convenient operator access to all receiver resources
and system features. The processor uses a patented single channel
interferometer DF technique providing accurate DF and excellent
sensitivity in a system that is low power and lightweight. It provides
superior performance with most modulation signal types including SSB
and OOK-Morse. The DF histogram display is particularly effective
during weak signal conditions, simplex nets, or adverse propagation
conditions that typify lower frequency bands.
The lightweight, low profile MA-445C HF/VHF/UHF antenna
provides accurate DF coverage from 2 to 2000 MHz. The MA-715A
T HE MD-405A R ECEIVER /

broadband dual whip antennas provide monitoring capability from 2 to 2000 MHz. The

during on the move missions, such as locating a downed pilot’s beacon. Other antennas
may be used with the system to optimize it for ground vehicle, maritime, or fixed site
applications.
The use of a low power design and effective power management allows the system
to be operated using the internally mounted MB-5700 NiCd or other approved battery.
An optional solar panel can be provided to power the system for extended operations or
to recharge the MB-5700 NiCd battery. Additionally other power sources can be utilized
with use of the provided accessory kit including local power at 110 or 220 VAC at 50 or
60 Hz, and direct DC power from 10 - 28 VDC.
