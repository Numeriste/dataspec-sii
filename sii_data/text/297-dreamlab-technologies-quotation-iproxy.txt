Dear Mr. Fischer
Many thanks for your interest in our services.
We are pleased to submit our offer for the Infection Proxy Project 1.
This offer shows you in brief the individual steps of our planned procedure as well as the costs for the individual
offer options. Please take note that this offer is heavily based on assumptions and preconditions as the network
analysis has not yet yielded in the results necessary to be able to quote without assumptions. However this
version reflects the feedback received in the last days thus leading to a final offer. Please take note that all
servers in this offer are non-clustered standalone systems; however Dreamlab recommends that at least all
network-relevant systems be run redundantly as a cluster.
Please call us should you have questions or comments regarding this offer.
We are glad to be able to support you with this project.
Yours sincerely

Nicolas Mayencourt
CEO
Dreamlab Technologies AG

1. Basics
This offer arose as a result of an inquiry by Gamma International and a subsequent collective visit in
Turkmenistan, as well as in consequence of the results of the current and ongoing network analysis.
Unfortunately the network analysis is not yet terminated, therefore this quotation is heavily based on assumptions
and preconditions.
Furthermore this offer is based on a request of Gamma International of Dec 13 th for a reduced offer with respect
to Offer 3104351.1 âInfection Proxy Projectâ of October 11 th 2010 which contained an offer for the Fixed-, the
TMCell and the MTS network of Turkmenistan.
1.1 Starting position and Objectives
After an inquiry by Gamma International, Dreamlab Technologies (Nicolas Mayencourt) and Gamma International
(Thomas Fischer) travelled to Turkmenistan. Preliminary investigations were made there concerning a network
analysis. This network analysis has in the meantime progressed a bit, and allows us, with assumptions and
preconditions, to submit a project proposal.
The original aim of the quotation was to cover all Turkmen networks with the infection proxy functionality, fixed
and mobile networks alike. This offer here is reduced to the Turkmentel Networks (Fixed and TMCell Mobile) only.
The LEA/LEMF will be able to operate and inspect this system through the Management Server as well as the
Management Client, both of which will be established within the LEA.
At the end of the project, the persons responsible should be trained in using the systems.
After the conclusion of the project, Turkmenistan will possess an Infection Proxy Infrastructure and Solution
applicable nationwide for all international traffic the Turkmentel and TMCell networks.
In this offer, all servers are offered as standalone systems in accordance with the request of Gamma
International. This does not comply with the best practices of Dreamlab Technologies, which envisage a
redundant implementation as a cluster for at least all systems that are network-related and involved in the
infection process.

3. Project Workflow and Deliverables
3.1 Network Analysis
At the beginning of the project is a detailed network analysis, which will provide the following information:
ï¬Knowledge about the local provider topology
ï¬Knowledge about target-identification possibilities
ï¬Deeper knowledge about the protocol stacks employed
ï¬Solution strategy for implementation
ï¬Documentation about the OSS BSS-landscape
At the present moment, the network analysis has already commenced, and the first results and solution proposals
are available.

Illustration 2: Infection Proxy at Tmcell

3.2 Project Management
Project management must be assigned for project planning, communication, and co-ordination; this will coordinate all tasks that arise, such as in particular co-ordination and communication within the teams, co-ordination
of on-site work, collaboration with the parties involved, ordering and monitoring of duties to co-operate,
guaranteeing of the provision of any existing dependencies, hardware assembly, factory testing, the provision of
all project-related documentation such as system and instruction manuals.

3.3 Devices and Infrastructure
Before on-site installation, the hardware will be assembled at Dreamlab Technologies and equipped with all
software components. Additionally, a detailed burn-in test will be undertaken before shipping. The systems will be
delivered to the desired address in principle ready-to-use. Dreamlab will deliver the following hardware and
software components for the project and it's three use cases:
3.3.1 Fixnet
Infection Proxy
The infection proxy is the actual core-component of the system; through them the entire traffic of the target is
conducted after the target identification. One non-accelerated infection proxy with 2 copper based dual port
network adaptors with 1 Gbit/s and automatic bypass function will be used.
Radius Probes
The authentications of the targets are monitored through the radius probes, so that the infection proxy process
can be initiated. One radius probe with two 4-port Gigabit copper network interfaces will be used to monitor and
intercept the accesses from the fixnet, as well as two 1 Gigabit ethernet TAP devices.
3.3.2 Tmcell
Infection Proxy
The infection proxy is the actual core-component of the system; through them the entire traffic of the target is
conducted after the target identification. The TMCell network is basically divided in a Huawei and a NSN domain,
therefore we will need to double the infrastructure involved to cover all parts of the mobile networks. One domain
consists of a non-accelerated infection proxy with 2 singlemode fiber based dual port bypass network adaptors
with 1 Gbit/s and the other domain consists of a non-accelerated infection proxy with 2 copper based dual port
bypass network adaptors with 1 Gbit/s.
Identification Probe
The identification probe will monitor and report the correlation between IMSI, TIMSI, MSISDN and the assigned IP
address in order to identify mobile users. One domain consists of an identification probe with two dual-port
Gigabit singlemode fiber network interfaces as well as two 1 Gigabit Fiber TAP devices, the second domain
consists of an identification probe with two dual-port Gigabit copper network interface as well as two 1 Gigabit
ethernet TAP devices. Both will be used to monitor and intercept the accesses from the Tmcell network .
3.3.3 Management Server
A management infrastructure will be applied for managing the infection proxies; this consists of a standard server
with management software and a client PC (Gamma-GUI) to administer the solution.

3.4 Training
Persons responsible will receive system training, including all necessary training documentation adapted for the
client system and in English.
3.5 System Care
Support and maintenance covers all activities in support of the client during operation of the installed systems and
in case servicing is needed.
3.5.1 On-site Maintenance in Turkmenistan
The SLA can be fulfilled without remote access and in the scope of an annual visit at the clientâs location, during
which updates and tests can be carried out, or open questions can be discussed with the customer. This can
occur every year, every semester, or every quarter. Since this is very much a security-related and sensitive
infrastructure, which is located in a public network, Dreamlab advises that the maintenance work be undertaken
as frequently as possible (every quarter, if possible).
3.6 Co-ordination Meetings
1x per year, and in addition to the system maintenance, a co-ordination meeting with the client takes place onsite, during which the needs and requirements of the client can be discussed, and where relevant information,
news, and current trends can be exchanged on a management level.

4. Limitations and Preconditions
This offer is made with the following limitations and preconditions. The following preconditions must be fulfilled by
Gamma International GmbH (hereinafter the client).
I.The client will forego all assertion of claims on account of any possible adverse effects and/or damages that may
arise in connection with the assignment. Reserved are damages that arise through serious negligence or
deliberate actions or omissions by the staff of Dreamlab Technologies.
II.The current approach covers all mobile and fix network of the country of Turkmenistan. Because vital data is still
not a 100% certain following possibly project and price relevant assumptions, limitations and preconditions apply
to this offer.
III.Turkmentel Fixnet
We refer positioning to the layout NWGraph with the Cartesian coordinates and the two network traces
(Turkmentel.pcap, Turkmentel2.pcap). We assume that the traffic sample Turkmentel.pcap has been taken on the
links between 2950 (D6) and 2960 or NAT in (C/D 3).
a)

All NATed customer traffic flows through the links between 2950 (D6) and 2960 or NAT in (C/D 3)

b)

All non NATed customer internet traffic flows though the link 2950 (D6) and Satgate (A7).

c)

All dynamic IP's are solely provisioned via RADIUS.

d)

All RADIUS traffic flows through the link between 2950 (D6) and 2960 or NAT in (C/D 3)

e)

The only RADIUS dialog that is provisioning dynamic IP addresses is shown in the Turkmenistan.pcap

in

packet number 7 and 8. The property to set IP's is âFRAMED-IP-Addressâ. A sample for a failed
Access-Request is documented in packet 5 and 6 in the same tracefile.

f)

If there are more RADIUS dialog variants they will be documented and outlined by the provider.

g)

We assume there is no other or more dynamic IP provisioning mechanisms in place.

h)

All fixed IP address traffic flows through the link 2950 (D6) and Satgate (A7).

I)

All links are based on copper medium and support 10/100/1000 mbs ethernet.

We have found non internal source IP addresses in the Turkmentel.pcap sample and need an explanation
how this is possible.
Please do precisely document any additional information, differences, amendments or comments.

IV.Turkmentel Cell
The Turkmentel Cell network delivers mobile IP services and is splitted in a Huawei and a NSN domain. Both
domains maintain one active and one passive link in between the SGSN and the GGSN
Huawei domain:
a) The Huawei domain's network is based on copper 10/100/1000 mbs ethernet media
b) The dynamic IP's of targets are provisioned on the Gn interface. The traffic sample
TMCell_Huawei_SGSN-Gn-1_active.pcap contains all provisioning mechanisms.
c) The mechanism for provisioning is showed in file TMCell_Huawei_SGSN-Gn-1_active.pcap in packet

1548

and 1560. The unique target identifier can be the IMSI or the MSISDN (phone number). In this sample the mobile
target receives the IP address 172.16.190.73.
d) All subsequent mobile IP traffic from the target is as well flowing through the same Gn interface found in
TMCell_Huawei_SGSN-Gn-1_active.pcap .
e) The same mobile IP traffic flows through the Gi interface found in TMCell_Huawei_GGSN-Gi- 2_active.pcap
without GTP encapsulation.
f) All mobile IP traffic is flowing through the Gn and Gi interfaces on the active and upon failure the passive link.
g) The TMCell_Huawei_SGSN-Gn-1_active.pcap traffic sample has been sniffed on the links between the SGSN
and the GGSN
h) The TMCell_Huawei_GGSN-Gi-2_active.pcap traffic sample has been sniffed on the links between the GGSN
and nsnfw01 and nsnfw02.
NSN domain:
a)

The NSN domain's network is based on fiber 1000 gbs ethernet media

b)

The dynamic IP's of targets are provisioned on the Gn interface. The traffic sample TMCell_NSN_0109Gn-1.pcap contains all provisioning mechanisms.

c)

The mechanism for provisioning is showed in file TMCell_NSN_01-09Gn-1.pcap in packet 532 and
533. The unique target identifier can be the IMSI or the MSISDN (phone number). In this sample the
mobile target receives the IP address 172.19.8.243.

d)

All subsequent mobile IP traffic from the target is as well flowing through the same Gn interface found
in TMCell_NSN_01-09Gn-1.pcap.

e)

The same mobile IP traffic flows through the Gi interface found in TMCell_NSN_01-09Gi-1.pcap
without GTP encapsulation.

f)

All mobile IP traffic is flowing through the Gn and Gi interfaces on the active and upon failure the
passive link.

g)

The TMCell_NSN_01-09Gn-1.pcap traffic sample has been sniffed on the links between the SGSN and
the GGSN

h)

The TMCell_NSN_01-09Gi-1.pcap traffic sample has been sniffed on the links between the GGSN and
nsnfw01 and nsnfw02.

10.2 Service and Security Level Agreement Reporting
In the course of the monitoring of utilisation, the degree of usage of various system services will be recorded and
translated into graphs. Through these data records of usage, the effective burden of the system can be visualised
graphically and it can be continually examined whether or not the system utilisation corresponds to the current
needs. In practice it is additionally the case that malfunctions or security problems affect the system usage. Via
monitoring such problems can thus be detected.

Map 3: Â© by Dreamlab Technologies AG

Map 4: Â© by Dreamlab Technologies AG

In addition, Dreamlab Technologies continually monitors the service availability. Service availability can be
calculated by means of the measurement data, as is shown by the following example:

Map 5: Â© by Dreamlab Technologies AG
By this monitoring of service availability, the availability of a system within a specific timeframe (usually a month)
can be calculated.
Both these types of report (availability and usage) will be made available to the client every month (electronically,
as a PDF). Only that which is measurable can be steered and controlled. For this reason, already a large number
of clients rely on the service and security level agreements with Dreamlab Technologies. The reports are ITIL-

compliant and are therefore very well suited to the support of managed processes in a company.

10.3 Alerting and Monitoring Infrastructure

10.3.1 Nagios tactical Overview

The tactical overview always shows all service and host checks that get performed and gives and overview of the
health state of the whole system and its corresponding services. The monitoring platform is service aware and
knows which services depend on what underlying systems. In case of outages or problems this screen directly
indicates the elements that need treatment.

10.3.2 Nagios Service Details

The service overview pane dissects the rendered services in its components. Each component is actively
monitored and in case of failure the operator knows exactly which element is causing issues. Of course a history
of all events is being kept.

10.3.3 Nagios Host Details

The host details pane shows all hosts participating in the system and its health state. From this screen the
operator can drill in the detailed checks and their corresponding history.

10.3.4 Nagios Host Group Summary

Modern services usually need more than one host to be rendered correctly. In the host group pane the operator is
shown the logical function blocks including its real time monitored health state. This is a great tool for first line
diagnosis of problems or anomalies.

10.3.5 Nagios Status Host Map

The host map shows the measured state in a topological manner.

10.3.6 Nagios Extended Host Process Information

This detailed screen shows the specific monitoring configuration on a per host basis.

10.3.7 Nagios Trend Host View

With the trending tool the overall availability and availability trends is being calculated in a format which is a
perfect basis to calculate SLA aspects.

10.3.8 Nagios Trend Service View

This example shows service outages on a timeline. Perfect for reconstructing events or managing outages.

10.3.9 Nagios Service Availability

This feature of the monitoring platform calculates on a per host basis the detailed service availabilities in a defined
timespan.

10.3.10 Nagvis Overview

With the Nagvis extension the whole monitoring infrastructure can be combined with informal layouts and graphs.
This tool is of great value and help in visualising the very low level technical measurements on very informal and
high level views enabling the operator to quickly identify potential problems.

10.3.11 Nagvis Overview

With the Nagvis extension the whole monitoring infrastructure can be combined with informal layouts and graphs.
This tool is of great value and help in visualising the very low level technical measurements on very informal and
high level views enabling the operator to quickly identify potential problems.

There is no limitation to the way the operator wants the service checks to be correlated and represented. In this
example a very high level country wide overview of a system is shown.

10.3.13 Nagvis Rack Overview

Combining multiple views and graphs lead to greatly reduced debugging times. From the very high level layouts
the operator can drill in up to the rack view and see where problems need treatment on a physical layer.

10.3.14 Nagvis Site Overview

This is another example of a very high level and highly condensed system view. Bear in mind that the informal
layouts get enhanced by the various real time checks which all get correlated and condensed leading to one
working or not working statement per logical unit.

10.3.15 Nagvis Overview

With this monitoring platform even virtualised systems can be dissected and shown in informal graphs.

10.3.16 Nagvis System Detail Overview

This example shows all actual performance consumptions on all systems in one singly page.

10.3.17 Munin Screen Overview

With the additional performance graphs every detailed measurement is shown in time series plots. Operators
therefore get a very detailed view of every single aspect of a service and host. With the help of the time series
and the operational knowledge the operators get a very detailed insight on any impact from any service
provisioning to the systems.

In this example the network traffic incoming and outgoing is shown. This is a great tool to identify performance
bottlenecks or as a great basis to enable forecasts.
