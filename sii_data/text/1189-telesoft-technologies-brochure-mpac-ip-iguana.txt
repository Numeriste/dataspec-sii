The MPAC-IP IGUANA 4x 10Gb/s card enables packet monitoring on Packet over SDH/SONET
and ATM networks. The card incorporates up to 4x 10Gb/s SDH/SONET optical monitoring ports
(STM-1/4/16/64 [OC-3/12/48/192]), capturing IP traffic from Packet/Ethernet over SDH/SONET
(PoS/EoS) structured transport interfaces.

Dynamically reconfigurable on-board packet filters ensure that the host application need only process
packets which are of potential interest. The IGUANA card provides packet filtering and delivery based
on packet headers – IP, GTP, MPLS labels, or other user-defined fields. It also identifies keywords deep in
packet payloads, and delivers the subsequent packet flow. These feature realtime capture of all critical
communication data, including those transported through network tunnels.

PoS/EoS network monitoring:
• Test and measurement
• Quality of service monitoring
• Cyber security
• Network Intrusion Detection (IDS)
• Lawful intercept

The packet processing offload features pre-process captured packets – grouping communication flows,
classifying and mapping protocol layers, parsing text protocol headers, and adding 4ns resolution
timestamp – freeing the host CPU to run high-level realtime packet processing applications.
The IGUANA card will either copy the captured, filtered, and pre-processed packets directly to host memory
via 8-lane gen2 PCIe, or forward them to a remote server via the optional dual on-board 10 Gigabit
Ethernet egress ports.
