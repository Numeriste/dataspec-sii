Why Speech?

Speech is a key
communication tool in
all fields of the human
activity

Voice can not be
lost or stolen

Speech
Using speech we can
identify the person
without any direct
contact with him

Samples taking
procedure does not
require any
additional hardware

Audio Forensics

Global leader in audio forensics
Over 15 years of experience
Forensic speaker identification.
Authenticity analysis of analog or digital
audio recordings.
Audio equipment for forensic
examination and identification.

Speech enhancement and audio
restoration.
Text transcription of low quality
recordings.

Audio Forensics

Automatic algorithms for real-time noise suppression and speech
enhancement.
Sound Cleaner Premium ! the first and the second prize in audio
enhancement contest by AES
(Audio Engineering Society), Denver, 2008

Efficient suppression of all types of
noises and distortions
Adaptive algorithms of filtering

Filters can be combined to process the
record simultaneously

Main Challenges

State-of-the-art voice-ID systems face four basic challenges:

Ensuring robustness to noise (real life audio)
Ensuring robust performance across different sound recording channels and levels of
speaker stress
Effective processing of large-scale (nation-wide) databases
Language and context independent identification

Speaker Identification Methods

Spectral-formant method
Spectral-forman( me(+o, -S/M1 is base, on (+e uni6ue s+a7e of eac+ 7erson9s vocal 
tract which is reflected in the visible speech of different people.

different persons is shown in the picture (The horizontal axis is time in seconds. The
vertical axis is frequency in Hertz. Energy level is depicted by the darkness of the trace).

Speaker Identification Methods

Pitch statistics method

Pitch statistics method (PSM) engages 16 different pitch parameters, including
average pitch value, maximum, minimum, median, percent of areas with rising pitch,
pitch logarithm variation, pitch logarithm asymmetry, pitch logarithm excess and 8
parameters more.

An e=am7le of au(oma(e, 7i(c+ e=(rac(ion in (+e 7+rase >/orensic au,io? 7ronounce, by 
two different persons is shown in the picture

Speaker Identification Methods

GMM/SVM method
In the GMM/SVM approach Gaussian mixtures are used to approximate statistical
distributions of MFCC (Mel frequency cepstral coefficients) parameters extracted
from speech of different speakers.
Support Vector Machines are a robust classifier in multi-dimensional space.
