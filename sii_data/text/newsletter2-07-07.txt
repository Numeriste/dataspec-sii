Pinpoint localization of mobile phones
The GSM mobile finder
(GSM-MF) enables pinpoint localization of mobile phones.
The device provides 50 reception
channels for selection of an unassigned frequency. The wide range of its
reception dynamics (-100 dBm to +7
dBm) ensures localization of both adjacent and distant mobile phones, in
combination with active GSM-off-air
systems (MTL3, GSM XPZ, GA900
etc.).
An especially designed aerial enables
systematic direction detection and,
thus, a rapid approach to the sought
mobile phone.

The CS 2000 has created a new network applications' platform - a general purpose deep packet processing
platform combined with an open Linux server blade. It is designed for applications focused on real-time network traffic processing.
CS-2000 provides the application developer high-speed processing, highspeed RAM, a high-speed database,
and a structured programming language for data plane-resident packet
operations.
This results in:
No more CPU interrupt latency
No more PCI bus bandwidth constraints
The power to operate on every packet – every bit of every packet – on
the wire in real-time
The CS-2000 also provides conventional Linux server resources for off-line
analysis and non real-time application
functions.

The CS-2000 enables users to implement their ideas, build differentiating
service features:
e.g. Shaping of IP-Traffic:
Reducing bandwith for voice over IP
(VoIP) in order to avoid the usage of
VoIP in IP networks
or Blocking of URLs:
Blocking of Skype, etc.

IP Sniffling &
Hacking
Monitoring of IP Data becomes
more and more important. IPMonitoring Systems currently on
the market will never be able to
monitor and demodulate all IPTraffic within IP networks due to
e.g. encryption, different access
levels, rerouting, new protocolls,
VPNs etc.

...and keep in mind

PC, using
highly encrypted
links and being
virtually undetectable

The Fintraining-Basic for one
week hacking overview-product
training (advanced course is
available upon request).

Therefore the direct access to a
PC is the only way to access data.
Sniffling and Hacking is one way
to realize this. Elaman provides in
this ready made products training
like
1) FinFisher (USB-Sticks)

The Hacking course for two
weeks includes the issues of
profiling of foot-printing, scanning
and enumeration as well as
attacking of passwords, web
security, bluetooth, networks,
wireless LAN, root kits and exploits.
The VoIP Course for one week
includes:

Passive
Telephone Line
Monitoring
The Zebra system is a powerful telecommunications
monitoring solution. The Zebra
system is suitable for law enforcement as well as intelligence gathering
and is scalable from 16 E1 carriers (or
equivalent channels) to more than
5,000 E1 carriers (or equivalent) in one
integrated system. Passive SS7,
R2MFC and SS5 protocol stacks support passive monitoring between switches in a carrier network, as well as
between the gateway switches. The
same passive protocol stacks support
interception of satellite streams. A passive ISDN stack supports trunk-side interception of PBX traffic.
The support for these interfaces and
protocols allow the Zebra system to be
applied to any type of monitoring in the
carrier network, including PSTN and
PLMN networks.
Passively – the system connects passively to carriers or bearers between
switches. Hi-Z buffers hide the Zebra
system from the monitored network.
No additional load is placed on the monitored network. Sessions on the monitored carriers/bearers are detected by
protocol analysis or VOX activity. The

Such a passive monitoring system is
capable of monitoring any configuration
of protocols on its input carriers, including: SS7 ISUP and TUP, SS5, R2MFC.
When no signaling is available recordings can be triggered on VOX. Future
versions of the system will support
H.323, SIP and other packet protocols.
The philosophy of the Zebra passive
monitoring system can be summarized
as: store everything, filter for known targets, and search the past for new targets.
The management of large amounts of
carrier cable can be a challenge, especially in large passive monitoring systems. We offer a modular coupling system that supports the connectivity
management of large numbers of monitored carriers in conjunction with optional high impedance buffering (Hi-Z)
and LED indication of the status of passively monitored carriers.
User workstation - for filtering and
browsing stored intercepts, playing audio and viewing fax/modem intercepts.
The Zebra enhanced user station that
will offer sophisticated filtering and
searching, playback and visualization of
content, as well as the viewing of
fax/Internet sessions.
The Zebra enhanced user station is also
designed with integrated link/network
analysis to assist investigators in the visualization of associations between targets.
