What is Lawful Intercept?

• 

The targeted intercept of voice and data services, by a service provider on
the behalf of Law Enforcement, when authorized by a court

• 

Uses:
–  Criminal - Investigation and Prosecution of criminal activity
–  Intelligence Gathering - Investigation of individuals for Homeland security, antiterrorism and other threats

How is Lawful Intercept performed?

• 

Identify the user
–  Determine the target identifier (phone number, email address, IP address etc.)

• 

Wait for authentication
–  When the target utilizes the network they must be authenticated. Watch for that
event.

• 

Find the edge
–  When the target authenticates, find the edge device closest to the target (so as
not to miss any peer-to-peer transactions) and obtain a copy of the target’s
communications.

Methods for Lawful Intercept
§ 

Active Approach
Ø  Work with the network equipment manufacturers to develop lawful intercept capability
in the network elements.
Ø  Utilize existing network elements for lawful intercept
Ø  Sometimes serious impact to network performance
Ø  No need for additional hardware

§ 

Passive Approach
Ø  Use passive probes or sniffers as Access Function to monitor the network and filter
target’s traffic
Ø  Requires expensive additional hardware
Ø  No impact to the network performance

§ 

Hybrid – utilizes both

The Burden on Law Enforcement
• 

• 

• 

The first tool available to track bad guys is with a subpoena for call records. This
is done on a regular basis and 10’s of thousands of these are done on an annual
basis. These are literally copies of relevant phone bills that are sent to the LEA
either electronically or as paper copies. Many times they are uploaded into a
Collection Function for analysis.
The next step is to get a warrant for a Pen Register or Trap and Trace. These
are historical terms used to identify calling activities (off-hook, ringing, answer,
disconnect, call forward, hookflash etc.). These events are sent in real time from
the delivery function to the collection function for analysis. Far fewer of these are
done then the subpoenas for call records
The last step is to get a Title III. This is usually only approved after a true need is
demonstrated to the judge. This is also quite expensive for Law Enforcement. US
law dictates that the intercept must be monitored live, 24 hours a day, by a Law
Enforcement agent and any part of the conversation that isn’t relevant to the case
must be “minimized”. In addition to the live monitoring (requiring multiple teams),
there is usually a ground team surveiling the target. So due to the significant
burden to justify the grounds for such a warrant and the manpower required to
support it, very few (relatively speaking ~1700) are done each year.

Recent Events

In 2004 the FBI, DOJ and DEA filed a joint petition asking the FCC to
clarify the implementation of CALEA for Broadband and VoIP
providers.
In August 2005 the FCC issued a “First Report and Order” deeming that
“Facilities based and inter-connected VoIP providers” must provide
CALEA support. It also required that compliance be achieved within
18 months of the Order.
In May 2006 the FCC issued a “Second Report and Order” confirming
that there would be no extensions and that the service providers
must come into compliance by the original date stated in the First
Report and Order.
On June 9th, an appeal made on behalf of Service providers seeking to
stall or alter the FCC report was denied by the DC Circuit Court and
the FCC ruling was upheld.
Service providers now have a true call to action and must come into
compliance by May 14th 2007
