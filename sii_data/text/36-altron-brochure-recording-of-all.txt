ABOUT THE COMPANY

Altron CJSC is a hight-tech company that creates effective complex solutions for security
management We provide our customers with the professional solutions designed on the basis
of the modern methodology using the latest technologies in the field of security.
At present we have carried out a lot of successful implementations in government institutions
of Ukraine (the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Air Forces, the Ministry of Emergency
Measures), as well as in commercial enterprises. Our company contributes to the strengthening
of the national security by means of development of the domestic technologies.

AMUR systems make it possible to solve both local operative tasks on recording data from communication netwo~< and to worl< out large solutions for soMng global tasks.

- It is designed on the basis of a specialised platform tor the buit-in system;
- The chassis is pelformed from metal. colour - black;
- The sizes: 20 sm x 20smx15 sm;
- 9ystem board mini-ITX based on the processor with ION level of pONer consumption (is characterized by high fault tolerance. compact
dimensions. sufficient productivity);
- In-built stereo- loudspeaker;
- There is no necessity in active means of cooling (non-ventilatory system);
- Adapter
- OS: WindONSXP Embedded;
- On the front panel there is a liquid-crystal display and 4 control buttons of record and reproduction allONing to mal<e adjustment of the
recording system and to worl<with base of records;
- Cost of the chassis without cost of AMUR PCl-printed-circuit-board does not exceed cost of the common personal computer.
