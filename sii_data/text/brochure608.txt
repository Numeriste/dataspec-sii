MA-308 Handheld DF Antenna
The MA-308 Handheld DF Antenna is a compact, lightweight direction
finding (DF) antenna used for search near-in field (SNIF) manpack
missions.
The antenna is used in conjunction with either the MD-403A or MD-405A
SIGINT Receiver/Processors. The operator steers the antenna in azimuth to
sweep an amplitude null across the signal of interest (SOI). A tone generator
contained in the receiver/processor changes frequency in proportion to the
signal’s strength. As the antenna is swept across the SOI, the tone heard in the
headset goes from high, to low, to high again. This allows the operator to
localize the direction of arrival of the signal.
The null depth of the MA-308 is typically 20 dB. Since a signal’s dynamic
range can easily exceed the typical null depth, a trigger switch is placed in the
handgrip of the MA-308. This trigger is used to change the receiver/processors
from DF to monitor mode. A “double click” of this switch causes the
receiver/processors to re-normalize the tone generator so that the antenna null
depth can track the receiver’s full dynamic range. When used with the
receiver/processor’s step attenuator, the MA-308 can get within a few
feet of a medium power transmitter without overload.
In the MD-405A receiver/processor a voice synthesizer can be
enabled in the System Setup Display to provide frequency
and detector information via the headset whenever the
operator presses the thumb switch mounted on the back of
the MA-308.
