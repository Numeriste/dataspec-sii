100 mW Video/Audio Transmitter

Model 5801

The video audio transmitter TSE 5801 is designed for short-range installations. It maintains
its accuracy by being stable in frequency and is ideally suited for those who demand the ultimate for covert surveillance.
Dimensions of the 100 mW version are 50 mm X 13 mm X 5 mm. The TSE 5801 100 mW
comes with a 6 VDC input, but with an optional remote control (incl. switching the video
camera on/off).
Transmitters operate at a frequency range between 985 MHz and 1.45 GHz. The TSE 5801VLR is perfectly suited to receive such a frequency. In addition, the receivers RV-2000 or
RV-2400 can be used or the receiving/recording case RC-105, which provides receiving frequency selection between 950 MHz up to 2.05 GHz.
