GSM Vehicle Direction Finder (VDF)
Overview

The VDF a complementary product to the GSM-XPZ, is a key element of
the MMI solution deployed to locate targets.

Based on the latest military technology, the DFV is a vehicle based
direction finding system that significantly addresses the weakness of
current direction finding systems. This significantly increases the
operational benefit to the customer:
• direction find targets to within a few metres
• azimuth and elevation target resolution
• direction finding on specific GSM timeslots
• multi-antenna array for accurate target resolution
• map overlay of target position data
• covert antenna fit

GSM-VDF Features

The VDF is designed to work in conjunction with the GSM-XPZ product
family. Available in 2 options, supporting either the Euro or US bands,
location finding of a radiating target mobile can be performed from a
vehicle.
Comprising of a multi-antenna array, system unit and laptop the system
can be either permanently or temporarily mounted in a vehicle using either
an external vehicle antenna or a highly covert internal antenna.

The antennas are very simply calibrated before the start of the mission
using a supplied hand-held calibration unit. The key features of the VDF are:
• Direction find to a preset GSM frequency and timeslot.
• Direction find to a preset GSM frequency (for GSM XPZ accurate DF
mode)
• Direction find simultaneously in Azimuth and Elevation
• Covert antenna mounted within vehicle or optional roof mount antenna
• Simple GUI display of direction in Azimuth and Elevation
• Display of historic vehicle and direction track
• Map overlay
• Capability for remote interface to other DF and XPZ devices
• Direction given in relation to North and vehicle direction
• Integrated GPS and compass
