CBRN VIP Protection
Awareness Course

CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL AND NUCLEAR (CBRN) INFORMATION COURSE

Introduction
The course has been designed to inform those interested parties who have not
had to deal with CBRN events in the past but cannot ignore the growing trend
within the terrorist community to use these materials to achieve their aims in a
more frightening and cost effective way. Additionally, it is designed to advise,
educate, inform and recommend to organisations and government decision
makers, on the right equipment, training and procedures best suited for their
needs to combat this threat.
Course Programme
The course has been designed to run for 10 working days and is conducted in
English. The length of course takes into account the need for interpreters in
some countries where English may not be widely spoken or there is concern
over misinterpretation of the information being given. The host country for the
course would be expected to provide adequate facilities and administrative
backup to run the course, including competent interpreters. A course programme
is attached and below are more details of the course content:
Threat Brief
This briefing puts into context the world-wide proliferation of Weapons of Mass
Destruction (WMD), the growing need for CBRN materials in industry and their
effects on people, property and terrain in the event of an industrial accident or a
terrorist incident. In particular it will highlight the growing incentive that terrorist
organisations throughout the world have in developing WMD weapons as an
alternative to the procurement of conventional munitions. Additionally, the brief
covers the risks posed by Toxic Industrial Materials (TIM) either from collateral
damage to industrial complexes or by deliberate acts of sabotage. The threat
from Low Level Radiation (LLR) hazards caused either by accident, collateral
damage or an act of war are also described.
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
This briefing is designed to show the appropriate types of PPE for the country
being visited and highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of wearing
protective clothing. During this period, those attending will be given the chance
to inspect and if required, don some items for assessment.

CBRN Characteristics and Effects
Three separate lectures will be given throughout the course to broaden the
audiences knowledge of the specific differences and effects these materials
would have on man, materials and his environment. This presentation also
includes some outdoor demonstrations.
CBRN Detectors
Separate presentations are given to show an array of different types of detection
devices that are available throughout the world and the advantages and
disadvantages of each. Some examples would be available for inspection and
assessment. These presentations would include outdoor demonstrations.
CBRN Decontamination Measures
A vital part of the protection against CBRN events is the ability to quickly and
safely carry out decontamination operations. This presentation is aimed at giving
information on the recommended methods used world-wide relating to these
operations.

The

presentation

covers

both

individual

and

collective

decontamination approaches along with showing a selection of decontamination
equipment.
CBRN Surveys
Assessing what, where and who has been contaminated in the aftermath of a
CBRN event is a vital part of returning to normality. This presentation looks at
various survey methods and the prioritisation of tasks.
The effects of Weather on CBRN materials
The aim of this period is to emphasise how weather can effect the duration a
hazard will persist for and the advantages and disadvantages of different weather
patterns.
CBRN Effects inside Buildings
Once inside buildings agents are concentrated and create special problems. This
period covers the general problems associated with CBRN materials once they
are inducted into a building.

CBRN Medical Concerns
Large scale conventional casualties will cause strain on the emergency services.
However, if they result from a CBRN incident then this can create immense
difficulties

and in some cases overwhelm those trying to rescue and treat

casualties. This presentation looks at the impact of these events and the
necessary medical countermeasures to mitigate the effects.
Command and Control
CBRN events can cause many casualties over a large area very quickly and trying
to control the situation is a massive challenge for the first responders. The
quicker the situation can be brought under control, the more lives can potentially
be saved. This period explores various software solutions that can assist the
emergency services and other organisations to collect, collate and analyse
information, in order to plan and control a CBRN situation from onset to return to
normality.
VIP Protection
The security and protection of High profile people, government officials and even
celebrities requires special countermeasures in a CBRN hostile environment. This
session provides information on the special measures, equipment and
procedures required to ensure the safety of VIPâ€™s before during and after a CBRN
event.
CBRN Exercises
Information will be given on the findings and lessons learnt from recent CBRN
exercises around the world, in order to assist the decision making process of the
host country.
Discussion Periods
Various discussion periods are spread throughout the course to allow for
consolidation of information, assessing possible equipment requirements and
suitable scalings. Additionally, these periods can be used to assess training
requirements and procedures.
