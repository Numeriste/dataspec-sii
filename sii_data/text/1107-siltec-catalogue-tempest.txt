TEMPEST KEYBOARDS
SIL720-KL105SC
The SIL720-KL105SC is a full-sized keyboard technology that uses smartcard
technology to prevent unauthorized access to computers and networks. This feature
boosts security, simplifies access procedures, and reduces the costs associated with
managing networks. The USB Smart Card Keyboard works with all smartcards that
comply with ISO standard 7816.
Smart Cards are easy-to-use credit card-sized devices which require multiple forms of
information to be validated before you gain access to your accounts or resources. Used
worldwide, smartcards strengthen access to a network or other resource using dualfactor authentication. Implementing a two-factor authentication (or multi-factor
authentication) process reduces the risk of unauthorized access by verifying and
validating your identity in one of the following ways:
- a combination of username and password or pin,
- a Smart Card.

managing networks. The USB Smart Card Keyboard works with all smartcards that
comply with ISO standard 7816.
Smart Cards are easy-to-use credit card-sized devices which require multiple forms of
information to be validated before you gain access to your accounts or resources. Used
worldwide, smartcards strengthen access to a network or other resource using dualfactor authentication. Implementing a two-factor authentication (or multi-factor
authentication) process reduces the risk of unauthorized access by verifying and
validating your identity in one of the following ways:
- a combination of username and password or pin,
- a Smart Card.

TEMPEST KEYBOARDS
SIL784-KL105SC
The SIL784-KL105SC is a full-sized keyboard technology that uses smartcard
technology to prevent unauthorized access to computers and networks. This feature
boosts security, simplifies access procedures, and reduces the costs associated with
managing networks. The USB Smart Card Keyboard works with all smartcards that
comply with ISO standard 7816.
Smart Cards are easy-to-use credit card-sized devices which require multiple forms of
information to be validated before you gain access to your accounts or resources. Used
worldwide, smartcards strengthen access to a network or other resource using dualfactor authentication. Implementing a two-factor authentication (or multi-factor
authentication) process reduces the risk of unauthorized access by verifying and
validating your identity in one of the following ways:
- a combination of username and password or pin,
- a Smart Card.

TEMPEST FILTERS

The SIL-TFS power filter series (6A, 10A, 20A) are designed to meet filter
attenuation requirements required for TEMPEST protection.
Filter technical parameters are compatible with installation requirements for
equipment on which confidential information is being proceed according to SDIP-29
standard.
The SIL-TFS filters eliminates or limits conductive compromising emanation as well
as provides overvoltage protection.
