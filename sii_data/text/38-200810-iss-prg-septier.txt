La#ful In*erce.*ion

The interception of telecommunications by
Law Enforcement Agencies (LEA's) and
intelligence services, in accordance with
local law and after following due process

Abou* Se.*ier
Founded in 2000
Privately owned
Develops advanced Telecom and IP solutions
More than 40 customers around the world

Technology & oem partnerships with:

Legisla*ion 6orces 7ommunica*ion
Service :rovi;ers <7S:s= *o Ac*
Dozens of countries around the world have legislated
lawful interception and intelligence gathering
Communications services providers must comply with
local laws and regulations in order to get and maintain
their licenses

The Results
Heavy investments are carried out by CSPs and LEAs
Systems procurement and installation
Systems maintenance

>conomical 7?allenges
Extract more security out of LI budgets
LEAs
Recuperate the cost of Lawful interception
CSPs
Maintain LI systems in a high level of service and
operations status
CSPs
LEAs

@?a* 7an Ae DoneC
Adopt a (dual usage. strategy whenever 
possible
Combine lawful interception with commercial
systems
! Share investments between LEAs & CSPs

Generate additional revenues for the CSP
Save costs for the CSP
Without scarifying performance and security
While fully complying with local laws and
regulations
