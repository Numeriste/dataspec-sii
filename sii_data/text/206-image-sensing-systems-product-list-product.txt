Ultra-Low Power
ANPR Processor Unit

The Blackbird Micro PC™ is a silent, miniature, low power
processor unit which runs the CitySync Jet™ ANPR Engine in
situations where size or discretion is important.
The small unit measures only l 01 mm x l l 5mm x 27mm and is
housed in a rugged aluminium case making it suitable for
mounting inside street furniture, vehicles or in restricted places.
The power consumption of only 8 Watts means that the unit con
operate on batteries for many days at a time . The pocket-sized
PC is fanless and the SSD version completely silent.
Small and green does not mean that the unit isn't powerful. The
Blackbird Micro™ is based around an Intel Atom™ processor
with up to 2GB RAM and integral hard disk making it capable of
reading plates from an ANPR camera with colour overview and
comparing them with Hotlists in real time. Results con be instantly
transmitted to a central server- or the system con simply store all
the plate reads until needed.
Most compact or embedded systems have problems
communicating with the outside world due to bespoke operating
systems requiring special drivers for comms equipment. Not so
with the Blackbird Micro. Not only does it run Windows™ allowing
a huge selection of devices to be directly connected, such as
3G modems or external relays, but it has several communication
options including Wi-Fi, USB, Serial and twin GigE LAN Ports.

Touch-screen Monitor
A 7" touch-screen monitor is available which complements
the Blackbird Micro PC perfectly due to its size and low power
consumption using just 2W at standard brightness. The monitor
con be powered from the PC .

Rugged ANPR Remote
Processor Unit

The Jet Blackbird ANPR Remote Processor Unit is
a powerful and compact PC platform running a
professional Microsoft operating system. lt is ideally
suited to remote ANPR usage where a small, robust
unit is required capable of withstanding the rigours
of an industriel environment.

The 19" unit may be housed in roadside cabinets
or CCTV column bases and connects directly to
up to four ANPR cameras and their overviews
monitoring moving traffic at barrier systems. Where
overviews are not required, you con install up to
8 ANPR cameras, or two ANPR and two colour
overview cameras. The Blackbird runs the powerful
Jet Automatic Number Plate Recognition software
which means that ANPR cameras no longer need
be connected to a central processing location
using expensive fibre connections. lnstead, camera
images con be processed at source and the ANPR
data (text and / or images) con be transmitted to
base as required using much less bandwidth thon
real-time video.
Data con be transmitted to servers using WLAN,
GPRS or WiFi options.
Two 3U Blackbirds con be fitted back to back in place
of a standard 4U rackmount PC. This is an excellent
feature when rack space is at a premium .

Features & Benefits
Powerful yet Compact
The Blackbird has been designed to fit into
a highly compact form factor whilst not
compromising on power or performance.

Robust Ali Metal Construction
Manufactured from 1.2mm steel the
Blackbird is designed for demanding
environments.

Anti-Vibration Disk Mountings
The extra rugged hard disk drive is fitted
with highly tuned anti-vibration rubber
dampers to provide protection from shock
such as con be caused by trucks travelling
passed at high speed.

Multi Port Connectivity
The Blackbird cornes equipped with five USB
Ports, Parallel, Serial and GigE Ethernet Ports
to suit a variety of infrastures.

1/0
A 16 channel 1/0 module is available to
allow monitoring of equipment (e.g. antitamper) and the contrai of external devices
such as traffic signais, LED signs and sirens.

Pole Mounted ANPR Processor
The CitySync Fox-in-a-Box (FIAB) is a discreet PoleMounted powerful ANPR Processor which resembles
a typical outdoor power supply containment that
blends in with most street furniture.

camera images con be processed at source and
the ANPR data (text and images or video) con be
transmitted to base as required using much less
bandwidth thon traditional video methods.

The simple but rugged casing contains a powerful
fanless ANPR processing unit with inputs for both
Fox Analogue ANPR cameras and the CitySync
GigE High Definition Fox-HD ANPR camera.

The FIAB contains a rugged SSD (Solid State Hard
Drive) allowing the processor to be mounted both
horizontally or vertically without the risk of a disk
failure . lt con store data for substantial periods of
time before being uploaded. This feature is essential
in situations where communication technology such
as 3G has network failures or network overloads.

The FIAB houses a stable power supply which also
powers the ANPR cameras .
The unit contains GPS equipment with optional 3G
and WiFi communication modules.
The FIAB runs the powerful Jet Automatic Number
Plate Recognition software and the unit is capable
of reading plates from passing vehicles travelling at
high speeds over lane widths of up to 6m making
it suitable for monitoring traffic in wide bus lanes or
vehicles passing across wide road junctions.
By housing the ANPR processor on the same pole
that the ANPR cameras are mounted, the cost of
installing a traffic ANPR system is greatly reduced
and this configuration removes the need for long
video or GigE cable runs back to roadside cabinets
with all their associated expense and installation
challenges. ANPR cameras therefore no longer
need be directly connected to a central processing
location using expensive fibre connections. lnstead,

Features & Benefits
Log vehicles with multiple images

The system is fully interactive and provides audible and
visuel alerts with 'action messages' for security staff.
lt is also ideal for Car Park Access Control and can
automatically open barriers or control LED displays for
known vehicles. The system works equally well with all
types of traffic.

Alert staff to vehicles of interest

The program consists of two parts: JetBase Live and
JetBase Review. JetBase Live is the heart of the ANPR
system - it monitors traffic via ANPR cameras and logs
any passing vehicles . lt uses an in-built proprietary
database with fully configurable fields . lt looks up any
registration numbers as the vehicle approaches and
displays any information ava ilable - e .g. Driver Nome,
Image of Driver, Vehicle Make / Model and any specific
instructions for the user - e.g. "Check Pass" etc .

Control traffic lights

The system con record multiple colouroverviewimages
of the car and driver from standard CCTV cameras
as the plate is captured . This adds an extra layer of
security to the system .

The JetCam Bollard range of cameras offer optimum
performance for access control systems 24 hours a
day in varying lighting and weather conditions. The
housing provides a mounting for the ANPR camera
at approximately the same height as front car plates,
reducing the issues with line of sight problems i.e.
tailgating or queuing traffic.
The cameras are designed to work with the infra red
retro reflective properties of number plates; the lighting
and filtering technologies employed overcome issues
associated with traditional CCTV cameras such as
headlight glare.

High Definition Infra Red
ANPR Camera
The JetCam Fox HD Dual GigE camera is designed for
use in applications where high resolution ANPR images
are required such as dual or wide traffic lanes. ln these
situations two analogue cameras often have a 'blind
spot' between the lanes and three cameras are normally
required for 7m wide fields of view. Such clusters of
cameras can look unsightly and are expensive to install
and maintain.
Standard analogue ANPR cameras cannot be used in
situations where more vertical resolution is required such
as in DSRC Tagging systems (Dedicated Short Range
Communications). ln such cases cameras are usually
mounted high (6 - 7m) and are expected to read plates
of vehicles within the normal DSRC range (7 - 12m).
This increased vertical angle results in distorted plates
which can only be read at high accuracy by using high
resolution vertical imaging. The JetCam Fox HD camera
delivers this.
The JetCam Fox HD has a horizontal resolution of nearly
1400 pixels easily covering 6 - lm of road . The increased
vertical resolution of over l 000 pixels is utilised by the Jet
ANPR Engine which is able to capture several images as
traffic passes resulting in increased recognition accuracy.
The vertical resolution maybe linearly traded off against
frame rate if required .
A new wide lane power-managed LED technology has
been employed ensuring that the Infra Red illumination
accurately matches the wider field of view. This increased
performance means that the camera will capture
plates at night against full headlights at a distance of
approximately 40m.

The star feature of the JetCam Fox HD Camera is its
intelligence. Communication with the camera is via
a GigE digital interface which means that the camera
con be controlled in real time from the Jet ANPR Engine
which constantly monitors the brightness and condition
of all recognised number plates. Jet then applies
dynamic contrai to various settings such as high-quality
digital gain and shutter speed - fine tuning the resulting
image which is then fed to the ANPR computer. This
dramatically improves ANPR recognition in very difficult
and changeable lighting conditions.
But it doesn't end there . High Definition ANPR images
require accurate vehicle identification and so the camera
is equipped with a second colour HD camera available in
several resolutions up to 1280 x 960 delivering one or more
crisp overview images with every plate captured .
These con be viewed using JetBase where the operator
con zoom into each image accurately identifying key
features.
The JetCam Fox HD is available with various combinations
of lenses for both cameras. The unit is compact measuring
only l 8cm in length powered from an external 24V (AC/
DC) supply making it both flexible and safe to install and
the camera con be attached to a pan & tilt unit.

The JetCam Fox-i Intelligent ANPR camera is designed
for use in applications where it is necessary to process
the ANPR images at the point of capture. Alternatives
include streaming all video back to a central control
room or using a rugged roadside processor such as the
Blackbird or Silverbird mounted in a waterproof, roadside
cabinet. Whilst the latter solution is very powerful, it can
carry a high installation cost which can prove prohibitive
for some applications.
Until now, ANPR providers have relied on powerful Intel™
based computers with bus-based video frame grabbers
to attempt to achieve high recognition rates from fast
moving vehicles. Leading engines such as the Jet™ ANPR
Engine deliver exceptional results by aggregating several
plate reads as a vehicle passes.
When faced with the chal lenge of producing compact
intelligent cameras most manufacturers have resorted
to using small low power digital signal processors (or
equivalent) to process the images on board .
These dedicated processors suffer in two ways:
They simply cannot provide the processing power
required for the best multi-read ANPR engines
Proprietary hardware does not lend itself to
modification or the addition of customised on-board
features
The JetCam Fox-i has been developed over several years
to address these problems and is based around a new
generation 1GHz processor running Embedded Windows'"
with 5 l 2MB of DDR2 SDRAM and 4GB of flash memory as
standard, additional memory available on request.

·=

=e i!:

The integral ANPR camera has a High Definition resolution
of 1280 x 960 for deployment on wide lanes, Toll Plazas or
site entrances up to Sm in width . An optional day/night
colour overview camera is available to capture not only
the plate details but also a colour contextual image of
the event.
The Fox-i is fully NAAS and BOF-2 compliant.
The resulting system uses minimal power and is fa st
enough to process at full frame rate as each car passes
the camera at high speed, resulting in what we believe
to be the most accurate intelligent ANPR camera on the
market.
Once the plate has been read, the Fox-i transmits the
plate text, with optional colour overview images via TCP/
IP over a network connection - or via the on-board 3G
modem.
The Fox-i camera con buffer up to 4GB* of event data
internally for later transmission . This means that over 1.6
million plates (data only) - or over 130,000 plates with full
colour overviews con be stored in an encrypted format at
the camera head if necessary. This buffering overcomes
any breakdown in communication or network bandwidth
problems.

The new JetCam HD Digital ANPR Camera Range
consists of a comprehensive choice of compact
cameras which are offered without external
housings and IR illumination for customers who want
to mount the cameras for exemple inside a vehicle
- or install them in their own housings.
There are two groups of cameras within the range:
Digital GigE Cameras and Digital IP Cameras.
The GigE cameras are very High Definition and
deliver crisp images to a processing PC using Gigabit
Ethernet. These are raw images and therefore of
the utmost quality when extremely high recognition
rates are required. GigE cable lengths are restricted
to 1OOm in length without using repeaters or fibre.
The IP cameras are a lower cost option. These use
on-board processors to compress the images to
M-Jpeg or Mpeg streams where they are directly
connected to host PCs using standard CATS cables
or they may be connected to an Ethernet switch
on a 1OOBaseT network.
Both types of cameras do not need frame grabbers,
the HD camera simply requires a single GigE Ethernet
Port and the IP a minimum of 1OO Base T connection
(as con be found on a laptop or covert PC).

Plate Device from CitySync.
JetMate is a fully portable hand-held ANPR device
running our internationally respected ANPR
Recognition Engine and a range of application
software.
The unit is supplied with a choice
of Windows CE or Windows Mobile Operating
Systems.
JetMate speeds up the process of collecting
vehicle number plates in the field by up to 30 times
over manual collection. The number plates con be
immediately checked against a database or later
downloaded depending on the application.

What does the device look like?
The device is based around the latest Casio
technology and has a high definition on-board
camera and 128Mb of RAM which will allow the
ANPR engine, application software and up to 5000
number plates and vehicle images to be captured
in one session.

How does it work?
The Device is pointed at the number plate of
stationary vehicles as shown above.
The number plate would then be read automatically
and stored with the captured image, date and
time. The above information will be displayed on
screen and added to a log file.

The accuracy of the Jet engine, in addition to
the storage capacity of the Casio unit, provides
the user with the raw materials to adapt their own
personalised applications. At CitySync we realise
that each client's needs are different and as such
we don't want to limit you to set functions.
With this in mind , we provide ail of our handheld
devices with an SDK (Software Development Kit).
This enables our clients to write their own software

Law Enforcement
ANPR Software
JetMobile™ is a simple to use ANPR system that
can be installed on your existing laptop or in-car
processor creating a powerful mobile Automatic
Number Plate Recognition system. Police users
can select from a range of cameras such as the
compact aerodynamic JellyBean Camera in order
to meet today's challenging AN PR requirements.
ln addition, long range zoom cameras con be
unobtrusively installed inside the vehicle allowing
officers to capture plate images covertly and
check all results against up to 200 hotlist data bases
in real time.
Key to its success is the officer friendly user
interface which contains large clearly identified
buttons allowing users to easily interact with the
system during vehicle operation . The touch screen
interface removes the need for a keyboard and
mouse whilst audible number plate alarms con be
processed with a couple of button pushes.
JetMobile™ con capture number plates from
vehicles travelling at speeds of up to 150mph. Two
dual ANPR cameras con be connected to a single
Panasonic laptop or equivalent using the CitySync
Hippo IP converter and up to six cameras con be
connected using the powerful Jet Mobile PC™ incar ANPR processor creating a very formidable
Police ANPR vehicle with panoramic ANPR vision.

The system includes a GPS mapping system which
accurately records the exact position and precise
time stamp of every ANPR read and hit. At the end
of every shift all collected plates con be wirelessly
uploaded to the Jet Back Office Suite JetBOF™ or
the National BOF-2 along with all plate hits. This
data contains plate details and colour images of
the captured vehicles together with all capture
locations. Hotlists con then be synchronised and
new Hotlists downloaded to the car ready for the
next shift.

JetOnline is a web-based ANPR browsing and editing
system that allows local network or remote users to
log onto a central ANPR System using a standard Web
Browser such as Microsoft Internet Explorer®. Once
connected, users con edit the ANPR vehicle database
(if permitted) and add new vehicles and driver details.
Alternatively users con browse or search the ANPR
events for specific vehicle movements or look at a
range of vehicle events over a specified time - all
without having any additional software installed on
the viewing PC. lt's all done via the web!
JetOnline consists of two main application areas:
JetBook and Jetlog.
JetBook gives remote access to the driver and vehicl e
database. Users con add, edit or delete records from
the data base or import other data bases . Multiple users
within an organisation con log on at the same time
to add records for new employees, or add expected
visitors so that the remote ANPR system allows them
access to a site.
Jetlog provides historical details of ail vehicle
movements recorded by the ANPR system including
images captured.

The results are initially displayed as a list with the most
recent record at the top of the page. The user may then
simply scroll through the log file pages. Alternatively,
powerful searches may be instantly performed on ail
historical data using a wide range of search criteria
such as date, exact time, plate or partial plate details
etc . Searches con include wildcards.

"'""'

,/ .,;!_,

The example shown illustrates the results of a
remote search upon the 'Employee' category
on Monday 5th Morch 2007. By clicking on any
entry listed, the ANPR and colour overview
images of that vehicle are displayed, and con
be printed out for later use.
lncluded with JetOnline is a Data Analysis
function. This allows a user to search through
the ANPR data and perform various analyses
such as calculating hourly volumes of traffic
passing an ANPR camera, or highlighting any
frequent visitors arriving at a site which may
merit furthe r investigation.
Another use would be analysing site data
by category (employee, visitor. contractor
etc) over a set period of time. The results are
displayed both numerically and graphically as
shown in the example.
Access con be restricted to certain database
categories depending on configurable user
permissions . This is very useful for sites with
multiple tenants .

JetOnline is often used to monitor what is going on at a
remote ANPR site - which may or may not be manned. A
security superviser may simply want to monitor vehicles
entering and leaving regional distribution centres and a
WebCam facility is included in order to enable this. Once
selected, the user receives video snapshots every few
seconds from the selected remote ANPR camera (or colour
overview camera). Note that an overview camera may be
used to view people, equipment and other abjects and is
not restricted to solely capturing vehicle images.

JetOnline has been tested using Microsoft
Internet Explorer 6, 7 & 8, Mozilla FireFox 1
& 2 and Safari 2 & 3, so con be logged into
from any platform that has one of these web
browsers installed.
JetOnline utilises Microsoft 's llS Server but
should also work using other web servers .
