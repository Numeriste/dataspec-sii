Semi Active
GSM Monitoring System

Stratign's Passive GSM Monitoring System is the most
advanced "Off-The-Air" GSM interception and
monitoring system that currently exists worldwide. The
system does not transmit any information and hence is
completely undetectable either by the operator or by
the target that is being intercepted.

"Off-The-Air"

GSM

Features of the system
• The System can monitor both forward and reverse
channels (duplex conversation).
• The system support FR, EFR, HR, AMR voice codec's.
• The system automatically handles Frequency Hopping and
Hand overs.
• Scalable for intercepting up to 16 simultaneous
communications.
• Multiple systems can be linked to achieve higher number of
simultaneously monitored channels.
• All intercepted communications are stored in a database
for easy access by the operators.

• Can work in Random Call Interception Mode as well as
Target Call Interception Mode.
• Selection of the Targets by different parameters such as
IMEI, IMSI, TMSI , Target distance from the base station,
Type of target handset, Target's dialled & received number
(PLMN).
• Possibility of round-the-clock operation in an auto mode
without the operator involvement.
• Remote operation of the system, using a wide area network
from virtually any part of the world.
• The system can be configured either as Portable (Carry
Case), Transportable (Installed in Vehicle) or Static (Fixed
Location).

as outgoing communications.
The system is capable of operating on all frequency bands
