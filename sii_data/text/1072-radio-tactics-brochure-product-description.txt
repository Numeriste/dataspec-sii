Version 4.8 release incorporates exciting new
capabilities and developments which further
enhance the "Ease of Use' experience.

SMARTPHONE APPS

SEARCH & USER EXPERIENCE

With the continuing proliferation of Smartphones and
associated 'Apps', ATHENA V4.8 now supports Application
Decoding capability when used with the latest version of
Analysis Suite.

Building further on the acquisition improvements
released in V4.7, this latest software supports more rapid
extraction of data from media cards. With an intelligent
split between the raw data and the associated file system
acquisition stages. An earlier on screen prompt is now
provided to remove the memory card whilst the file
system is built from the acquired raw data . As memory
card capacities and data volumes continue to increase
this change can save up to half of the time for the media
card acquisition stage .

This is enabled for the most popular 'Apps' with dedicated
decoders to present important data that is often stored in
proprietary formats within the device. This data can include
user details , app passwords, contact details as well as
conversational chat messages and other data . The ATHENA
and Analysis Suite implementation ensures that this data
can be extracted and viewed in a systematic manner.
The following application decoders are included in this
V4.8 release:
