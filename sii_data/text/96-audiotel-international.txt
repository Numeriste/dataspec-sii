Eavesdropping devices - bugs
There 1s no doubt that electronic hstemng devices commonly known as bugs
are actively being used throughout the world
Spec1a 1st retail outlets mail order catalogues and Internet Webs tes are home
to a vast number of comparnes selling hstemng devices some costing as little
as a few tens of pounds Even the most expensive of devices can be seen as
inexpensive m comparison to the value of the information sought
With technology becoming increasingly sophist cated m crophones can be
found the size of match-heads and recording devices can take shape as
everyday ob;ects such as pens and wristwatches
Mobile phones are such a part of everyday hfe they are rarely given a second
thought yet they are increasingly being used as hstemng devices and covert
cameras Many leading suppliers offer customised services allowing customers
to choose virtually any ObJe~to conceal their device

When searching for active RF transmitter listening devices speed is essential If
important meeting areas are under threat from electronic eavesdropping
minutes or even seconds could potentially be worth tens of thousands of pounds
to an eavesdropper
The detection and locatmn of 1lhc1t RF transm1ss1ons requires swift and s1lert
action to 1dent1fy and locate listening devices on the Radio Spectrum without
alerting potential eavesdroppers to what 1s happening
Scanlock M2 makes the detection 1dent1f1catron and location of covert radio
transmitters quicker and easier than ever before
Imagine how long rt would take to manually tune a radio into every station on the
FM banawrdth te dentrfy what was transmitting at each frequency
With Scanlock M2 you can not only cover the FM bandwidth but all frequencies
up to SGHz m less than 5 seconds
The Globa Spectral Analysis Software adds a further d1mens1on to 1dent•fymg
