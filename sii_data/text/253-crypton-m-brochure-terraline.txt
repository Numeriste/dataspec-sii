Trunk-based communications monitoring system

"Terraline Portable"
The system is intended for operative control of up to 8 duplex digital E1 trunks of fixed phone network or
GSM cellular communication network. "Terraline Portable" system allows to provide fast monitoring of
currently interesting connections. The optimization of used software enables to combine on one PC th e
abilities of big stat ionary monitoring syst ems.
"Terrallne Portabl e" system provides:
·Monitoring connection, tapping and translation of up to 8 duplex digital trunks of E1 standard
(G. 703) 75/120 Ohm;
· Procession of digital trunks with ITU #5, R1, Rl .5, R2, DTMF, R2D, ISDN, EDSS1, SS#7 signaling;
· Procession of digital t runks of GSM cellular communications network with A or A- ter interfaces;
·Automated selection of sessions by phone numbers, M SISDN, IMSI, IMEI, Cell ID;
·Demodulation of fax sessions, according to V.27ter, V.29, V. 17 and V.34 fax recommendations;
·Procession of MH, MR, MMR, ECM, JBIG, JPEG protocols.
•Demodulation ofV.21 , V.22, V.22bis, V.26, V.26bis, V.27, V.29, V.32, V.32bis, V.33, V.34, V.90 modem sessions;
·Decoding and error correction V.42, V.42bis, V.44, CODEX, MNP 1-5, HDLC, PPP, Slip, UUCP, IP, TCP, UDP, SMTP,
POP3, IMAP, MIME, FTP, Web, X-Y-Z modem and Kermit protocols etc;
·Support of the local database, providing the storage
phone numbers of interest and search of information
about the required communication sessions;
· Automated archiving of the recorded information into external digital media;
\l.J\'\
· Automated operation of the system according to pre-set scenario;
·Possibility of the remote access to the system via LAN, WAN, Dial-up, Leased line.

"Terraline GJobaJ"
The"Terraline"Global Monitoring System (hereinafter as "System") is designed for auto·
matically input, record and process communication sessions from digital trunks with dif·
ferent kind of sig naling such as ITU #5, R1 , R1 .5, R2, DTMF, R2D, ISDN, EDSS1, SS#7 and
A or A·ter interfaces. The System provides dassificatio n of sessions according to signal
forms (voice, fax or data) and their storage during predetermi ned time together with the
session-related Information (date, time, duration, calling and called telephone number,
TMSI, IMSI, IMEI, cell's number etc.). Also System provides an ability to determine a loca·
ti on of the selected/targeted mobile subscriber while the session is in progress.
"Terra line Global" system provides:
•Monitorin g connection, tapping and translation of digital trunks of E1 and STM1 -16;
·Procession of d igital trunks w ith ITU #5, R1, R1.5, R2, DTMF, R2D, ISDN, EDSS 1, SS#7
signaling;
· Procession of digital trunks of GSM cellular communications network with A or A-ter
interfaces;
· Automated selection of sessions by phone numbers, MSISDN, IMSI, IMEI, Cell ID;
• Demodulation of fax sessions, according to V.27ter, V.29, V.17 and V.34 fax recommendations;
· Procession of MH, MR, MMR, ECM, JBIG, ~PEG protocols.
·Demodulation ofV.21 V.22, V.22bjs, V.26, V.26bis, V.27, V.29, V.32, V.32bis, V.33, V.34,
