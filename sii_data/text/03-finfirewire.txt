Tactical IT Intrusion Portfolio
FINFIREWIRE

Technical Surveillance Units and Forensic Experts often face
a situation where they need to access a running computer
system without shutting it down in order to prevent data
loss or save essential time during an operation. In most
cases, the Target System is protected with a passwordenabled Screensaver or the target user is not logged in
and the Login Screen is active.
FinFireWire enables the Operator to quickly and covertly
bypass the password-protected screen and access the
Target System without leaving a trace or harming essential
forensic evidence.

Usage Example 1: Forensic Operation

Usage Example 2: Password Recovery

A Forensic Unit entered the apartment of a Target and
tried to access the computer system. The computer was
switched on but the screen was locked.
As they were not allowed, for legal reasons, to use a Remote
Monitoring Solution, they would have lost all data by switching off the system as the hard-disk was fully encrypted.
FinFireWire was used to unlock the running Target
System enabling the Agent to copy all files before
switching the computer off and taking it back to Headquarters.

Combining the product with traditional Forensic
applications like Encase®, Forensic units used the
RAM dump functionality to make a snapshot of the
current RAM information and recovered the Hard-Disk
encryption passphrase for TrueCrypt’s full disk encryption.
