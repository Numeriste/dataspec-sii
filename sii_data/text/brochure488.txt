Mirador
360-degree continuous rotation camera system

The Mirador provides an unrivalled video surveillance capability through
the use of an innovative 360-degree continuous rotation camera system.
Its unique gas-sealed case design and range of detachable accessories
makes the Mirador an essential asset for covert surveillance operations.
Specialist cameras for a specialistrde
Having to adapt existing video technology to the changing
operational environment is a situation common t o many
surveillance planners. In many instances, standard video
surveillance equipment is not robust enough to cope with
the most hostile of operating environments and often
modifications are costly and time consuming.
In response, Mirador has been developed to overcome
the most common of these problems - whilst at the same
time avoiding compromises in quality of video collected.
Designed t o incorporate best of breed video technology
with a unique continuous 360-degree view of the subject
area, Mirador significantly enhances situational awareness
without the need for unreliable ad-hoc adaptations.

Practicaloperational benefits
Due to its mechanical design, the Mirador has the capacity
for unlimited 360-degree rotation and offers both optical
and digital zoom capability. Furthermore, the unit is fitted
with a lens that features a high quality zoom and image
stabilisation function, allowing users t o focus on distant
objects with exceptional clarity. In addition, Mirador
features a proportional zoom facility that slows the speed
of camera rotation during the zoom function, to thereby
allow a steady, smooth pan and tilt at greater distant. This
also offers highly accurate 'cue t o slew' functionality.
A range of detachable PODSfurther enhance the Mirador
and include embedded recorders, triggers and alarms to
extend the capability of the unit into a standalone remote
surveillance system. Mirador's auto sensing protocol
capability allows a true 'plug and play' capability when
connecting into an existing surveillance solution.

Operational domains

Mirador is ideally suited to deployment by organisations
in law enforcement, military and transportation domains,
as well as by those responsible for securing public spaces.
Its unique form factor and innovative 360-degree
capability make it ideal for a range of static and dynamic
operating scenarios including:
Covert surveillance operations
Mobile policing/rapid response (crowd monitoring)
Tactical surveillance capability (e.g. covert
observation posts)
Critical infrastructure protection (e.g. utilities)
