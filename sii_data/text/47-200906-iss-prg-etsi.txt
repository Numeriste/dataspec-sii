Why study on Retained Data in EU
15th of March 2006: the European Parliament
and the Council of the European Union adopted
Directive 2006/24/EC on Data Retention

Data generated or processed in connection with the provision of
publicly available electronic communications services
or of
public communications networks
14
need to be retained

Track 3 ! 4 June 2009, Prague; ETSI/TC LI activities on Retained Data and Lawful Interception

Applicability Directive
q The content of the communication is not part of the directive
q Data to be Retained
" Successful and unsuccessful communication attempts
" Wireline network telephony / Wireless network telephony
" Internet access / Internet e-mail / Internet telephony

q Categories of data to be retained
"
"
"
"
"

data to trace and identify the source of a communication
data to identify the destination of a communication
data to identify the date, time and duration of a communication
data to identify the type of communication
data to identify users' communication equipment or what purports to
be their equipment
" data to identify the location of mobile communication equipment

Why standardisation of RD handling
q Easier to define own storage and delivery mechanism
" No need to define/invent complete own delivery / receiving system
" National options are possible

q ;B*ea7er@ 7ro2uc)s
" Manufacturers need to develop one basic product
" National options are additional

q Data Retention result is meeting international and national
requirements
q RD Standards in ETSI are actively developed in good
harmonization and are approved by all involved parties
q Common way for all involved parties
q Continuous increase in types of Retained Data
" Use of the telecommunication
" Number of different services used
" Number of different access networks used

Why Lawful Interception implementation in EU
17th January 1995: EU Council of Ministers
adopted resolution COM 96/C329/01 on Lawful Interception

The providers of public telecommunications networks and services
are legally required to make available to the authorities the
information necessary to enable them to investigate
telecommunications

General on security of LI feature
q Parties in the communications
" Neither the target nor the other parties involved in the
communications should be able to detect that interception is
(de)activated or that interception is taking place

q Other users
" Other users of any telecommunications service should not be able,
by any means, to detect that any interception facility has been
(de)activated or that interception is taking place

q Protection of Target information
" Protection of Rooms, Systems, Connections

q Local staff
" Only authorised personnel may have knowledge that interception has
34
been activated on a target
" Unauthorised persons shall not be able to detect that any
interception is active on certain subscribers
