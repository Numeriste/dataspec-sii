Know the Unknown Communications
Targets on modern IF networks can communicate over
a wide range of P2P protocols. It is a tedious process to
detect and decode such communication channels as
hundreds and thousands of new services are being
added every day.
ClearTrail's next generation LI system identifies such
channels that enables LEAs to zero-in on precise
protocols hence providing timely intelligence. Moreover,
the same monitoring approach proves equally relevant
to both. LEA•s as well as Intelligence Agencies, by
helping them intercept information that is not even
exchanged among partners in crime.

ClearTrail unified monitoring platform supports both
switch as well as probe based interception over a
variety of voice and IF networks. It facilitates correlation
and retroactive analysis of the intercepts captured
across diverse networks providing a complete view of
the suspect's communication.
The unified platform comes with futuristic database
design that can handle Petabyte of information. It has
been architected for mass monitoring of voice & data.
The entire functional elements of database can be
scaled linearly and provide consistent and predictable
performance over time.
Standards and Regulations
Our systems meet LI regulatory requirements across
the globe. These are compliant with ETSI and CALEA
regulations. Our products are efficient to cater to region
specific requirements too.

For off-the-air interception
of mobile communication
GSM communication stands at the center of
today's communication, transmitting vital a n d
often highly sensitive information while
simultaneously connecting users to essential
resources. The dependence on GSM is growing
rapidly. paralleled by unlawful communication
and which is largely a safe media for criminals to
organize and operate global terror networks. Law
Enforcement Agencies across the world are
scouting for solutions to intercept GSM
communication for acquiring evidence to prevent
such criminal behavior.
Solutions deployed in the mobile operators
networks to intercept such communications are
costly. resource consuming and don't provide the
flexibility of intelligence gathering operations.
What is ideally required is a portable GSM
Lawful interception solution that provides the
following benefits to the LEA:
Stealth mode operation, transparent to target
Rapid Intelligence gathering in the field
Small portable footprint
No assistance or information required from
the Mobile Operator
mTrail offers passive and active 'off the air lawful
Interception of GSM 900/ 1800/1900 Mhz phone
calls and data to meet law enforcement
surveillance and investigation requirements.

Dual Mode Interception
ClearTrail offers Active and Passive off-the-air
interception systems. In the latter, it works in the
stealth mode so that neither there is
dependence on the network operator nor the
user(s) would come to know about the
interception.
Scalability
The system is able to support multiple bands
(900/1800/1900 Mhz) by adding appropriate
modules, The system has the capability to scale
from interception of 2 channels (carrier
frequencies) to 32 channels.
Mobile or Fix mode of Deployment
nnTrail offers two modes of deployment mobile
and fixed. In the mobile mode the system is able
to fit into a rugged briefcase. In the fixed mode,
the system fits in a rack-mount industrial grade
chassis.
Target Selection
The target(s) can be profiled using signal
strength, target numbers like IMSI,TIMSI. IMEI
or MSI SDN.
