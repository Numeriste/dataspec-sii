text messages sent
in 2010.
• And what about
phone calls, faxes,
chat sessions, etc. ?

The limits of traditional approaches
Keyword Technology
or Statistics
Breaks text into single words
without considering the
context, like reading a
language that we don’t
understand:
Az IBM szokásosan nagy hangsúlyt
helyez a továbbképzésre, így
munkatársai évente számos szakmai
tanfolyamon vesznek részt.

Shallow Linguistic
Technology
Recognizes words and identifies
their most basic forms
(lemmas), but cannot
distinguish between different
meanings.
Sell -> Selling -> Sold

Neither understands the meaning of words.

Where semantic technology excels

One keyword, many
different meanings.
Over 231 million
results
for a single query.

The information we need is harder to find

Productivity of search

The increasing amount of information
• 15 Petabytes of new information a day
• 15 million searches a month
The diminishing effectiveness of search
• 1/3 of searches do not find intended results
• Over two hours a day are spent searching for information

Why we are different
Semantic technology understands the meaning of
words in the same way you learned to read.
•  It understands the relationships
between words.
Luke (subject) has eaten (verb)
a chicken (object).
•  It understands the meaning of
words.
To eat (chicken); to consume
(oil); to destroy (sweater); to
spend (money); to rust (the
tower), etc.

Next generation technology

The problem of text analysis
Same word,
different
meanings

Different words,
but the same
meanings

Different words,
related
meanings

How Cogito works

12

What is a semantic network?
A rich map of associations and meanings of words.
•  Includes all definitions of all words.
•  Includes relationships between all words.
The quality of results is derived from the richness and complexity of
the semantic network.

•

350,000 words
2.8M relationships

The semantic net, the heart of Cogito
Traditional technologies can only guess the meaning of words
using keywords, shallow linguistics and statistics.
Instead, semantic networks can identify:

Abbrev.

American city.”

Connections

Phrases

Meanings
Domains

“San Jose is a
geographic part
of California.”
