Remote Monitoring & Infection Solutions
FINFLY LAN

Some of the major challenges Law Enforcement agencies
are facing are mobile Targets, where no physical access
to a computer system can be achieved as well as Targets
who do not open any infected Files that have been sent
via email to their accounts.
In particular, security-aware Targets are almost impossible
to infect as they keep their systems up-to-date and no
exploits or Basic Intrusion techniques will lead to success.

FinFly LAN was developed to deploy a Remote Monitoring
Solution covertly on Target Systems in Local Area Networks
(Wired and Wireless/802.11). It is able to infect Files that
are downloaded by the Target on-the-fly, infect the Target
by sending fake Software Updates for popular Software
or infect the Target by injecting the Payload into visited
Websites.

Usage Example 1: Technical Surveillance Unit

Usage Example 2: Anti-Corruption

A Technical Surveillance Unit was following a Target
for weeks without being able to physically access the
target computer. They used FinFly LAN to install the Remote
Monitoring Solution on the target computer when he was
using a public Hotspot at a coffee shop.

FinFly LAN was used to remotely install the Remote
Monitoring Solution on the computer of a Target while
he was using it inside his hotel room. The Agents were
in another room connected to the same network and
manipulated the Websites the Target was visiting to trigger
the installation.
