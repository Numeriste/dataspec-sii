40 000 channels plus in high density
Petabytes of storage
Covert and passive interception
Multiple agencies
IP, TDM; satellite, international
switching centers, mobile, submarine
landing stations

!Conventional systems not suited

What if sys'em is available '.a'…
! Provides LI targets while supporting intelligence
community
! Provides unique intelligence proposition (go back in
history)
! Requires low vendor support dependence
! Is flexible to adjust to changes in threat, technology
and communications, operational conditions
! Dense, scalable and distributable
! Benefit naturally from technological advantages

The ideal solution
Changing communications environment
(Satellite, landline, mobile; circuit and packet switched;
different protocols)

Suitable active/passive gateways
(E1/T1, E3/DS3, STM-1/-4, IP)

Off-the-shelf Processing and Storage
(Networked architecture; distributed implementation;
content capturing - records and stores everything;
content enrichment 7 speech analysis, etc)

Integration API
Industry leading applications
(Intelligence mining, extraction)

Key characteristics
! Record everything that it is connected to
7 No switches 7 no previous target knowledge required
7 High intelligence value 7 analyze and listen to the past

! Software centric, aimed at integration
7 Fax, data and satellite DCME demodulation integrated as
software
7 API to integrate to customer applications and analysis tools

! 8ommercially available :off-the-s.elf; .ar<6are
7 Low vendor dependence
7 =enefi' from Moore5s la6

Key characteristics
! Highly scalable and distributable
7 50 000 channels+ with unified view
7 Add more servers into Capture Unit
7 Add more Capture units

! High density
7 500 stereo E1s per 42 U rack
7 64 stereo E1s in 1U interception on remote sites 7 small
footprint!

! Groups and permission based security
7 Tagging and workflow

! Advanced CIC mapping

Storage flexibility - example
All intercepts in 64 kbps stereo for 5 days

All voice
compressed 8 kbps
stereo 360 days

All fax and data
uncompressed for
further 30 days

Fax and data
compressed for
remainder of 365
days

All known target content for additional year online archive

Exporting and migration

All IRI for 2 years

Content enrichment and
intelligence extraction
! OCR and text search
! Speaker identification and speech tools
! Customer applications

Conclusion
Passive surveillance is complementary
to LI
! Provides a much larger pool of information
! Helps identify targets and prevent incidents

Systems do exist that provide large
scale passive surveillance capabilities
while:
! Providing unique intelligence value
! Protect investment against changes in technology
! Low vendor hardware dependence
