ALIS

Lawful Interception
“ALIS, the most ﬂexible Lawful
Interception Management
System on the market”

Overview
The AQSACOM Lawful Interception System, ALIS, is a convergent Lawful
Interception solution for all voice and data networks (PSTN, GSM, GPRS, 3G,
LTE, CDMA, WCDMA, VoIP, xDSL, Satellite, E-Mail, etc.) using a centralized
management platform.

The customer beneﬁts of ALIS include:
> One point of contact for the LI management to ensure state-of-the art security and
reliability.

> Flexible interfaces with either Internal Interception Functions (vendor equipment
internal interception functions – IIF) or External Interception Functions (Probes – EIF).

> Solution scalability to ensure cost-eﬃciency for Communication Services Providers
> Solution ﬂexibility to adapt to Law Enforcement requirements.
> Clear pricing and technical strategies based on a transparent and constructive
collaboration.

ALIS’ seamless network integration, distributed architecture and centralized
management allow Communication Services Providers freedom from
dependence upon proprietary network equipment and solutions. At the
same time, with ALIS, evolutions within the CSP’s network remain
transparent to the LEA.
The ALIS platform is easy to use and requires minimal operator training, which
substantially reduces the direct cost of performing lawful interception tasks.
Collectively, ALIS’ features optimize operational and recurring Operator costs.

ALIS Overview
ALIS Core
This is the hub of ALIS. From the Core System, the mediation process between
the network entity and the LEA domain is managed. The functionality of the
ALIS Core remains the same regardless of the network and technology (PSTN,
GSM, GPRS, 3G, LTE, CDMA, WCDMA, VoIP, xDSL, Satellite, etc.).
The Core contains the basic software components needed to set up the Lawful
Interception System, including the Network Connectors, Technology
Connectors, LEA Connectors for HI2 and HI3 delivery and optional HI1 LEA
Connectors for provisioning. The Operator and Administrator Clients are also
included in the ALIS Core.
The Core can be upgraded to integrate any newly emerging demands for more
comprehensive Security, Redundancy, Alarms and Statistics.

ALIS Network Connector (NC)
Network Connectors manage the provisioning workﬂow of the intercepted
targets for a designated network. NCs are also referred to as Application
Connectors. Examples include: PSTN, GSM, GPRS, 3G, LTE, CDMA, WCDMA,
VoIP, xDSL, Satellite, etc. There is a 1:1 ratio between a NC and a network or
application. Multiple NC’s can be managed by a single ALIS platform.

ALIS Technology Connector (TC)
Technology Connectors manage the dialogue between the ALIS platform and the
Interception Function (IF) in the network. Interception Functions can be either
internal to the vendor/network equipment (IIF) or external using probes (EIF).

ALIS LEA Connector (LC)
LEA Connectors manage the dialog and the intercepted data transmission
between the ALIS platform and the LEA equipment that typically resides in a
Monitoring Center. Depending upon the requirements, the interception data
could be routed for use in other additional applications such as data storage
and retention.
