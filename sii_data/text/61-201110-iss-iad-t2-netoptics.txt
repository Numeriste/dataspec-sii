Unique Operational Challenges With 10G
Common Lawful Interception deployment challenges:
Lack of Tools
• Availability of 10G
monitoring tools and
10G security tools

Quality
• Content classification
as an example: It’s
hard enough on 1G…

• Tools ability to operate
at line rate with low
latency

Cost
• New 10G tools (not
the 10G network
interface cards)
• Leveraging existing
investments of 1G
tools
• Cost of knowledge,
migration, operations
= TCO

Other Technical Challenges
Jitter, Oversubscription and Blocking are more severe with 10G
networks:
Switching
Oversubscription
• If the queue exceeds the
size of the physical
hardware buffer, packets
are dropped

Latency and Jitter
• At any time, only one
packet can be
transmitted from each
physical output port of a
switch
• Resource contention
might happen when two
packets arrive from
separate input ports to
the same output port
(e.g. uplink) at about the
same time

Microburst

Bandwidth
Utilization

Even at low traffic, when average traffic is low, head of line blocking
phenomenon (“oversubscription” ) causes queuing à short periods
where the instantaneous bandwidth can reach maximum utilization

Access Switching: Do More With Less
10/40/100 Load Balancing
– 
– 
– 
– 

Share the load between multiple tools
Centralized intelligence for more endpoint
Leverage existing / cheap / 1G tools
Plan for growth

Pre-filter with DPI to detect desired traffic on any port
–  Pre-filtering is a mature technology
–  DPI allows to identify data of interest and forward to the monitoring/
recording tool

GRE tunneling
–  Distribute the collection infrastructure

Cloud Monitoring
–  Inter-VM and cloud based monitoring

Any type of media
–  Fiber, copper or both
18

Summary

Modern and advanced Access switching technology
provides the scalable solution to meet Lawful Interception
challenges in high capacity networks by focusing on
improving collection infrastructure.
