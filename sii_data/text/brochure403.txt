It is a cooperative endeavour by the government of Mexico City, one of the
world's largest megacities, Telmex, a leading Latin American telecommunications company, and Thales.
Thales has applied the latest available technology to provide videosurveillance services, process emergency calls and manage events. Drawing on
its experience in the defence sector, Thales has all the expertise required
to implement its technologies in complex environments, adapt solutions
to requirements and provide the necessary training.
This is the most ambitious public safety project in the world, with more
than 500 engineers and experts from the Mexico City police department,
Telmex and Thales working together.

DEFENCE & SECURITY C41 SYSTEMS

>> Urban security, Mexico city
The Solution
Thales and Telmex have delivered a
centralised C41 centre, which coordinates
five regional command-and-control centres in charge of multi-agency public
safety operations both on a routine basis
and during emergency situations.
The solution includes videosurveillance
[8,080 cameras dedicated to urban
surveillance, traffic management and
license plate recognition), operational
forces tracking and status monitoring,
emergency call handling and dispatching
of first responders and other forces.
The project also includes two mobile
command-and-control centres receiving
information from unmanned air vehicles
deployed for remote surveillance. Both
these components of the solution facilitate
decision-making and response processes
everywhere in the city.
