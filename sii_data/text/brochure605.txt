MA-445C
HF/VHF/UHF DF Antenna
The MA-445C HF/VHF/UHF DF Antenna provides accurate direction finding
(DF) over the 2 to 2,000-MHz frequency range in a small and lightweight unit.
The antenna was designed for use on vertically-polarized ground wave
and sky wave signals. The MA-445C may be ground or tripod mounted,
and can also be operated from the top of a ground vehicle with a
metal roof using Linkabit’s optional vehicle mounting strap. In the
AN/PRD-13(V)1 and AN/PRD-13(V)2 system configurations, a
common RF/control cable is used to connect the MA-445C to
Linkabit’s SIGINT receiver/processors (MD-403A and MD-405A).
The MA-445C is physically divided into two frequency sections:
2–100 MHz (called the HF portion) and 100–2,000 MHz (called the
VHF/UHF portion). The unit design incorporates several antenna technologies:
• Ferrite-loaded crossed loops plus a short active monopole whip
covering 2–100 MHz
• An annular slot with eight feed points covering 100–460 MHz
• A four-element monopole array covering 460–2,000 MHz
Each antenna section has an independent calibration (frequency versus angle)
correction table read by the receiver/processor on power-up, as well as an
independent built-in test (BIT) oscillator to help isolate failures between antenna
sections. The VHF/UHF section contains a switchable low noise, high
performance preamplifier. The preamplifier can be enabled to improve antenna
sensitivity and offset coaxial cable loss.
