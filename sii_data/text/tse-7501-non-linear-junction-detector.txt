TSE 7501 NLJD Non-Linear Junction Detector
TSE 7501 is small, lightweight and robust for the harshest of environments. Non-linear Junction
Detectors are an essential tool for electronic countermeasure searches, explosive ordnance disposal
and a variety of security applications.
The TSE 7501 is a state-of-the-art Non-Linear Junction Detector which valuates hidden electronic
devices, regardless of whether the electronic device is passive or active.

Technical Advantages
Channel selectable; four operating frequencies to ensure potential interfering signals are avoided,
(FCC 915MHz, EU 869 MHz and classic 888MHz; available in one unit for universal operation). The
four spot frequencies are customer selectable.
High Power Transmission to rapidly search a large area with greater penetration; adjustable poer
control 2mW to 1Watt (2Watt optional).
Constant power transmission, as opposed to pulsed operation. (Conitnous transmission reduces
risk of missing a threat from inadvertent rapid movement of antenna head.)

Provides evaluation of both 2nd and
3rd harmonic returns. Strong 2nd
harmonic (red) indicates true electronic
components, while strong 3rd harmonic
(green) indicates false corrosive
junctions. Received signal strength
indication of RX1 (true target) &
RX2 (false target).

Revolutionary design; all in one single
body unit, or as with previous TSE models
the antenna is separated from the
control module.

XD Advancements
Unique 4-way thumb control conveniently placed on display screen for most commonly used
functions.
Ergonomic sweep head with increased sensitivity reduces search time, 6dBi gain.
Circularly Polarized Antenna improves reliability, and redues risk of missing a threat due to incorrect
antenna polarization.
Quick fit removable smart battery housed inside control module; provides over 2hrs operation.
Minimum set-up time; exttension Lengths 52 - 208 cm.
Robust, lightweight aluminum, fiberglass and carbon design; operational weight only 2 kg; in transit
case 5.6 kg.

The TRANSIT Case has a double saftey lock. There is a pressure release valve positioned below the
handle. Should the equiptment be subject to change in altitude or temperature the valve will
automatically open.
