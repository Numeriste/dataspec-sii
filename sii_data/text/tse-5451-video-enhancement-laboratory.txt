Video Enhancement Laboratory

Model 5451

TSE 5451 system for video and still picture enhancement is designed for use by law
enforcement agencies and organizations. In addition to the full range of image enhancement features listed below, the TSE 5451 system also offers an audit trail with
playback facility (to replay processing operations), case management and tools for court
presentation. The processed video may also be displayed on a second external PAL
video monitor. The TSE 5451 also features de-blurring capabilities, integration of nonconsecutive frames and a macro builder facility.
The user interface enables operators with no previous detailed knowledge of image
processing to use the TSE 5451 effectively. The functional system is capable of digitizing up to 10 seconds of uncompressed live video to memory. This allows the operator
to browse through the captured sequence to select optimal images.
The TSE 5451 system runs as a 32 bit multi-threaded application under Windows XP
Pro; normally supplied with a state-of-the-art PC, a suitable high performance graphics
card and a video frame grabber.
A video source (PAL/NTSC/SECAM) can be connected and viewed live in a window. To
record video in real-time uncompressed on a hard disk and manipulate the data is easy.
Just as if it is on a VCR; press record and the computer does the work. After recording,
operations can be performed on the sequence, e.g. integration, stabilization, moving object integration or applying filters on the complete sequence or subsequence.

Movie Pack
Moving object integration is possible: a person or number plate in a sequence can be
tracked and consequently integrated. A jolting sequence caused by a moving camera
can be stabilized and all filters can be applied to a complete sequence, such as a filter/LUT, Stretch, Equalize and Moving Average operation.

Office Pack
The operator can design his own report format and layout through MS-WORD. Own
logo, address, image caption, etc, can be included and printed seamlessly with the
processed images of the TSE 5451.
DV Pack
TSE 5451 allows to load, display and process digital video (avi,jpeg); a number of digital
formats can be loaded and processed. It is completed with a tool for controlling the digital
recorder. A digital device is connected into the fire wire connection; a choice can be made
as to which one is used as frame grabber.
Raid
Besides providing image enhancement operations, the TSE 5451 contains the RAID functionality; the capability of recording live uncompressed video up to 6 hours to a hard disk
array. The recorded images are displayed in the live window and the scroller.
A variety of operations is possible with reference to sequences:
• Browsing: Scrolling through the sequence and selection an image
• Field/frame conversion: stepping per field/frame and deinterlacing
• Replay: replaying the whole (or part of the) sequence once or cyclic, back or forward and in different speed
• Annotation: images are assigned a unique sequential number. This annotation
feature guarantees the integrity of the image capture and processing without the
need for final storage of the entire sequence
• Multi-selection: selecting more images at the same time and saving as a new
sequence (can be used for manual demultiplexing)
• Integration: efficient integration of images
• Display: adjustable display area sequence. The preview images in the scroller
show an adjustable zoomed part of the images of the sequence
• Dual Monitor operation: use two large monitors for a more convenient and efficient operating environment
Separate packs are:
• Offline Demultiplex packs
• TV output pack
• Track pack
Noise Reduction
TSE 5451 offers three filters for noise reduction (average, median and low-pass) where the
filter strength is determined by a single parameter.
Contour Enhancement
TSE 5451 has a set of seven contour extraction filters and user definable kernels. The result of the filter is added to the weighted original image, giving the effect of contrast enhancement.
De-blurring
This may be accomplished by three different algorithms, based on "inverse filtering". Deblurring requires the operator to set only one or two parameters.

Contrast Enhancement
The contrast of the image can be stretched automatically and a manual grey level map may
also be used for more complex scenes. Thermo-graphic images can be processed with a
pseudo-color facility. Grey level mapping produces a live update of the image and its histogram.
Geometrical Correction
Portions of an image may be warped using a second-degree polynomial to compensate for
perspective distortions.
Image Integration
Dark images can be enhanced using integration. The operator may do this manually,
adding image by image, or automatically in real-time up to a maximum of 10,000
frames. Non-consecutive frames may be integrated as well.
Case Management and Security
All operations relating to a case are stored in an audit trail for that case. The TSE 5451
can replay the functions contained in that audit trail.
Image Sequence Browser
The TSE 5451 has the ability to capture up to 10 seconds of uncompressed video to
system memory. The user can easily step through the captured image sequence to select the most useful images. Since the VCR has not been operated in jog mode, the images retain maximum quality, while tape damage is minimized.
Presentations
Several dedicated drawing tools are included to allow the creation of (court) presentations. The tools are secured from image editing use. Presentations may be recorded directly to VCR or printed on hardcopy video printers.
