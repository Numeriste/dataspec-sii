Remote Control Systems - 150

Programming device â€“ DAS 4005 PROG
General
The programming device serves for individual setting of the remote control address and the
DES encryption code of the audio transmission system DAS 4005 RC.
By means of the programming device all 16 address-bits can be set, since the DAS-RX 4005 RC
only allows adjustment of the first 4 bits of the remote control address.
The DES encryption code of the digital audio transmission system DAS 4005 RC comprises a
total of 56 bits of which 16 bits can be adjusted by means of the programming device.
If only one bit of the DES encryption code is changed, the received signal will not be
analyzable.
