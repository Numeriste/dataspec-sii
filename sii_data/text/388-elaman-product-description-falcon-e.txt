GSM-Monitoring System Semi Active – Falcon E+

Description
The Falcon E+ system is designed and developed as a Semi Active OFFTHE-AIR-GSM-Monitoring system. The system provides the option of both
stationary and mobile operation
The Falcon E+ system deciphers A5.1 and A5.2 ciphering algorithms
online. The system does not require the service providers SIM for
operation because uses cloning of the targets phone in real time.
Therefore, all the calls made by the target are billed into its account

Main Features
•

The system ensures monitoring of audio and data traffic within standard
GSM 900/1800 networks (800/1900 on request) and deciphers A5.1 and
A5.2 algorithms online

•

Default configuration of the system – 8 or 12 reception channels (4 or 6
duplex channels, monitoring of both forward and reverse conversation
channels)

•

The system ensures registration of radio-electronic-conditions within the
radio cells to be monitored (frequency and characteristics of BCCHchannels)

•

The operator can select the required targets based on their IMSI or IMEI.
Upon selecting the targets the system acts as a virtual base station (BTS)
for these targets.

•

When one of the targets initiates a call, the FALCON E+ system
automatically calculates the ciphering key ant authentications
parameters. These parameters are then cloned onto another mobile
phone attached to the system (up to 4). The targets calls are now routed
through the cloned mobile phone, maintaining the same encryption and
target identity.

•

The system contains a database (up to 1000 calling partners), operating
in real-time, which can be accessed corresponding to the selected search
criteria and parameters.

•

Calling partners are identified according to the IMEISV, IMSI, TMSI, ISDN
number (local and international number)

•

Retrieving of target IMEI/IMSI for using targets mobile number and silent
call

•

Registration and storage of telephone conversations, call related
information, network information and Short Message Service (SMS) to the
system`s hard disk.

•

The system ensures registration and storage as audio codec – types FR,
EFR, HR.

•

Playback of recordings may be carried out by the system itself

•

Identification of SMS and DTMF data.
