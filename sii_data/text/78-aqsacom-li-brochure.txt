ALIS, the AQSACOM Interception Management System, comprises two components: IMS-m for target
provisioning and IMS-d for data interception management. IMS-m operates in conjunction with the service
provider’s network access switching and servers (e.g., RADIUS) to determine the target’s originating IP
address (static or dynamic). Once this address is known, IMS-d routes a secure replication of all
incoming/outgoing target IP traffic to the law enforcement agency for analysis.

AQSACOM develops and markets real time Lawful Interception, Mobility Tracking and
Surveillance solutions. With its core business focused on lawful interception and related
applications for over ten years, AQSACOM provides end-to-end turnkey solutions for
fulfilling lawful interception requirements anywhere in the world, especially over highly

portfolio includes clients from more than 30 countries, covering geographical areas as
