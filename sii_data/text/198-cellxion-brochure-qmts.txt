QMTS
Quad Modem Telemetry System

I

*_

The quad modem telemetry system (QMTS) is a multi-role communications
platform designed to simultaneously utilise the wireless data networks of
up to 4 mobile network operators in a single geographic location. Data is
shared between carrier networks and aggregated in a central secure server
before being sent to any number of configured client machines. Sharing
the data payload across multiple networks leads to higher throughput and
greater resilience.
The device has an integrated router that manages the packet queue
internally, with all traffic carried over secure tunnels between the QMTS
and the secure server. In addition t o providing secure, reliable IP transport
at up to 4x a single modem solution, the QMTS has built-in GPS for
accurate position reporting and tracking.

KEY APPLICATIONS

BENEFITS AND KEY FEATURES

QMTS SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

I

Data from the the QMTS is split up and transmitted across
separate mobile networks to the secure server. The secure
server aggregates the data streams in the correct order.
Traffic streams to and from the secure server are encrypted
and within VPN tunnels. Remote devices such as cameras
and surveillance are connected to the QMTS via the two
Ethernet interfaces.
