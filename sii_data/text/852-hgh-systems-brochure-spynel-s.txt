Spynel is the impressive system for all-weather, 24/7 surveillance of ports, sh ips,
platforms at sea, ideal for perimeters over several kilometers. This unique infrared
sensor displays a full 360-degree panorama, with a resolution up to 30 Mpix. With
its near real-time imagery, Spynel detects and tracks unlimited movements night
and day. With a large MWIR focal plane array, Spynel-S exhibits high performance,
especially in warm and humid regions.

EARLY WARNING OF ASSYMETRICAL THREATS
Compact and fully passive, the Spynel is completely insensitive to jamming and
deception. Unaffected by sea clutter, this surveillance device is highly effective
when tracking small crafts, RIBs, wooden boats and swimmers. lt can be a reliable
and cost-effective stand-alone perimeter security solution as well as an added layer
of capability to systems already in place.
