Intelligent Optical Signal Management
The Glimmergiass Intelligent Optical System 600 revolutionizes optical signal
management by enabling network operators to rapidly and remotely access, distribute
and monitor optical signals and create and reconfigure optical paths in real time.
Advanced management software combined with purely optical, photonic crossconnects provide remote operators with superior visibility and control of optical signals.
Intelligent Optical systems provide transparent signal access and are key enablers
of the Glimmerglass CybersweepTmn. Their unique capabilities enable the dynamic
selection and distribution of optical signals for analysis and storage.
Glimmergiass optical systems enable operators to:
• Access and monitor optical signals in real time without disrupting traffic
• Remotely create and reconfigure optical signal paths in milliseconds
• Handle any data rate, any protocol and any format including DWDM
• select, duplicate, and distribute optical signals to one or many locations
• Continuously monitor signals and remotely test and diagnose optical paths

Outstanding Reliability
• MiBF ' 30 years
• Dual -46V DC or redundant, h o t

Advanced Optical signal Management
• Optical power monitoring
• Threshold crossing alerts
• Protection switching rules
• Photoriic multicasting for connecting point to
multipoint
• Dedicated or switched Variable Optical
Attenuation (VOA) to control output power levels
• Virtual Private Switch (VPS) allows administrators
to partition ports for individual user access
• Bidirectional operation

Create
Glimmerglass systems provide a fully iron-blocking, transparent cross-connect. In
milliseconds an optical path can be created between any fiber input and output. Since
the technology is fully transparent the newly created optical path will transport any
signal regardless of data format or speed.

Monitor
Continuous optical power monitoring combined with transparent switching forms a
superior solution for remotely monitoring network paths and performing diagnostics.
Loopback paths may be created in milliseconds to help isolate a fault to a particular
piece of equipment.

Reconfigure
Glimrneglass systems are the ideal solution for remotely adding, reconfiguring, and
disconnecting optical paths on demand and making system level topology changes.
