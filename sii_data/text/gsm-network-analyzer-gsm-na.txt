GSM Network Analyzer – GSM-NA

Description
Sound operation of IMSI detection devices requires a precise analysis of the GSM
network. The GSM-NA identifies all important data of the existing GSM networks
in one particular location. Through a specific evaluation process, the user is offered
a suitable radio cell to ensure sound functioning of the IMSI detection device. A
tabular listing of settings also permits manual selection.
All providers present in a particular location are analysed. Identified data are stored
corresponding to their location. A SIM card is not necessary.
