Digital Audio Transmission System – DAS-4005RC
General

The DAS 4005RC, based on SMD technology, is a small audio transmission system designed
for the UHF-BOS-band. A remote-controlled audio transmitter and an audio receiver with
integrated remote control transmitter constitute the system. Transmission of digital data
occurs on the basis of the transceiver principle. Range of audio data transmission is equal to
the range of the remote control.
Within the transmitter audio signals are digitalized through a 10bit A/D converter and,
afterwards, encrypted with a 56 bit code through the data protection system DES.
Transmission of digital audio data and reception of remote-controlled commands occurs via
same antenna. Uninterrupted transmission of audio data packages enables, at the same time,
reception of remote-controlled commands. All settings can be remote-controlled (On/Off,
output power (PWR), power save (PS), internal/external microphone, VOX, channel, address).
