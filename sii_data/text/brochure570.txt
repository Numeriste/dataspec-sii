AUDIOCLEAR
DNCS-2/R DIGITAL NOISE CANCELLING PROCESSOR

AUDIOCLEAR

incorporates advanced signal processing algorithms, which are specifically designed for the
removal of background noise from speech on a continuous and adaptive basis. This technology enables the
recovery of voice audio that is clear, distinguishable and intelligible from signals that are, in many cases,
unusable.

A major operational advantage of this technology is that, once connected, no operator adjustments are required
as the software "learns" the structure of the audio signal on a real-time basis. The necessary corrections to the
signal are then applied automatically so as to produce the best possible signal-to-noise ratio.
A SUPERB PORTABLE SYSTEM FOR USE AS A BASE
PROCESSING UNIT OR FIELD DEPLOYMENT SYSTEM
This totally self-contained unit can be used in a variety of
ways to increase the clarity of voice communications and is
ideal for use as a surveillance base unit. It can be used to
drastically reduce incoming noise from radio monitoring
receivers. telephone line intercepts and GSM phones. Existing
noisy audio tapes can be simply played back through the unit
to copy and virtually eliminate tape hiss and other background
noise.
The unit is housed in a rugged waterproof case and is
supplied with a mains battery charger. demonstration tape and
full lead set.
