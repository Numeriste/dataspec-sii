Voice Biometric Solutions:

VoiceGrid '"
VoiceGrid: Nation-wide multimodal biometric system
liceGrid imptements, maintains and automates a
,, ,i;sal
biornetric database system at local, regional
and/or national levels
egrated STC bi0rnetriccapabilities perform 1:F-I search
and automatic biometric identification
Forensic investigationof biometric data provides
admissible evidence in rnurt pr~ceedinw

The solution for identity authentication and verlficatlon based on
the combination of two biometric technologies used covertly speaker identification and face recogn~tion.Networked l:N search
and biometric data management solution with unlimited database
size and unlimited web client workstation connectivity. Distributed
processing and WAN architecture designed for Large c~ty,county,
state or national system deployments.

"

There is no need to contact with the individual when enrolling biornetric samples
More accurate results are received due to the combination of speaker identification and
face recognition technologies
LOW costs of samples enrollrnent, system deployment and exploitation
Both biometric technologies are enabled to work on the databases of large volume
