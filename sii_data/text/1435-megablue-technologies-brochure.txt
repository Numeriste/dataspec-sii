TRANSPORT HUB COUNTER-FLOW

DNA-Tracker® - CF Analyser®
DNA-Tracker's Counter-Flow Analyser is a cost-effective, hardware and

software solution, which identifies device movement patterns that are contrary
to the normal behaviour pattern for a particular setting.
For example: - The normal behaviour pattern at a passenger terminal is for
individuals to move steadily towards the boat, aeroplane or train they are
catching. If a device is moving against that normal flow pattern or failing to

make progressJ then that behaviour may need to be investigated?
The system produces a 'Counter-Flow Alert', processes captured data in realtime, displays the relevant information, (device ID codes, triangulated position,
dates, times and counter-flow duration), onto control room screens, or via
laptops for temporary deployments.
DNA-Tracker therefore delivers the capability to investigate and intervene
rapidly, allowing control room staff, CCTV operators and officers on the ground
to work in an efficient, coordinated manner.
