Spectrum occupancy
higher density
higher number of coms
increase of the bandwidth to monitor
higher bitrate/Hz => more
compressions
vocoders
corrector codes
multiplexers
proprietary modes
…
crypto use
=> It is getting more complicated

Impact on Communication Intelligence Electronic Warfare missions

October
2008

- Broad spectrum monitoring
- Multimode/reconfiguration
- Multiple simultaneous networks monitoring
- Access to the content issue =>
- Increasing need for cryptoanalysis : « back in USSR »
=> direction finding
=> technical analysis
=> surgical neutralisation
