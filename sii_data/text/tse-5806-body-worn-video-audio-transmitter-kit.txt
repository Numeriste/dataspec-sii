Body-Worn Video/Audio Transmitter Kit

Model 5806

The TSE-5806 camera transmitter kit is designed to allow
the operator true flexibility when using body-worn equipment.
Using the latest lens technology, it is possible to disguise
the camera lens as a button, allowing the operative to fit
the camera, transmitter, microphone and battery pack neatly, and importantly, covertly into a jacket.
The TSE-5806 video/audio transmitter kit operates on low
band frequency, giving the best transmission results when
body-worn. The transmitter will not only transmit the video
signal, but also the audio on the built-in audio sub carrier.

The kit consists of:
• Video Audio Transmitter
• Stubby 0dB Antenna
• Color Button Camera
• Camera Battery Pack
• Set of Spare Buttons
• 12vdc Power Lead with
Binder Connector
• Analog Microphone
• BNC – RCA Adaptor
• Battery Pack
• Battery Charger
• Equipment Vest
