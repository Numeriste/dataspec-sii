SATCOM to Keep Highly Mobile, Dispersed and Remote
Users Connected
Linkabit’s MPM-1000 modem with its Network Centric Waveform (NCW)

FEATURES:

reduces operational cost and supports the maximum number of IP users by

• EXTREMELY EFFICIENT USE OF
SATELLITE RESOURCES
– ADVANCED MF-TDMA WITH A
BANDWIDTH-ON-DEMAND DAMA
SCHEDULER

providing extremely efficient use of satellite bandwidth over any Military or
Commercial transponded satellite.
The NCW is the Army’s Open Standard (Non-Proprietary) Waveform that
provides optimal network performance in any SATCOM architecture with any
size terminals. It provides a fully certified secure network that is self forming

Any large aperture terminal can operate as the Network Controller and there are
allowances for automatic or planned Network Control handover. It supports Full
Mesh (Peer-to-Peer), Hub-Spoke and Hybrid Networks. It provides Hub Assist
for increased throughput of severely disadvantaged terminals.
The MPM-1000 provides for real time, secure services such as full duplex VoIP,
video and/or data transfers. It also provides outstanding Communications
On-the-Move (COTM) support.
