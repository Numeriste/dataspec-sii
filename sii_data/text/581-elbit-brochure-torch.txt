C4I in Action
To meet the challenges of Netcentric Warfare (NCW) and reap the benefits of true
battlespace digitization, military organizations are turning to field-proven C4I solutions
from Elbit Systems Land and C4I - Tadiran
The only C4I solution to be fully deployed and operational force-wide in a major military organization - the Israel Defense
Forces (IDF) – the TORC2H® system covers all army branches and echelons, enabling universal situational awareness, in-depth
collaborative mission planning and management based on near real-time information, and an always-updated Common
Operational Picture (COP).

C4I for the Real World
TORC2H® is a complete and integrated operative-level C4I
system, built from the ground up to meet real world needs
in the full spectrum of military operations.
Unlocking the barriers of traditional stovepiped and
proprietary systems, TORC2H®’s all-in-one approach uniquely
supports all command echelons – from Battalion through
Corps or Theatre, and everything in-between. TORC2H®
also supports all battlespace disciplines - Intelligence,
Operations, Fire Support and other Combat Support (CS)
elements, Logistics and other Combat Service Support (CSS)
elements - offering true universal situational awareness.
TORC2H® offers optimized data collection and dissemination,
faster sensor-to-shooter response time, and a uniform
collaborative operational picture - enabling faster and more
qualitative decision making.
Modular, scalable, and upgradable, TORC2H® is based on
an open architecture, seamlessly integrating with existing
systems, communications infrastructure, and sensors – while
at the same time taking full advantage of Elbit Systems
Land and C4I – Tadiran’s advanced hardware and renowned
communications systems.

Fully Deployed in the IDF

Key TORC2H® Features

Selected by the Israeli Ministry of Defense as the core
Command and Control application in the IDF’s landmark
Digital Army Program (DAP), TORC2H® is already fully
operational.

Collaborative tactical operations
•	 Powerful data synchronization overcomes network
limitations
•	 Optimal utilization of network resources
•	 Autonomous sites with no single point of failure
•	 Preserves data availability - sites mutually back each
other up
•	 Preserves continuity of operations - functionality available
from any site in work group

The first next-generation C4I system to be deployed
and used on a large-scale under actual ongoing combat
conditions, TORC2H® was readily adopted and well-received
by all IDF command echelons. Together with comprehensive
fielding and training programs, and including significant
integration efforts with existing and new systems, TORC2H®
has delivered real-world C4I usability to the IDF – providing
on-the-ground proof of the efficacy of Netcentric Warfare
(NCW) doctrine.
