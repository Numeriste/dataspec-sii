ASIGN (Adaptive System for Image Communications
in Global Networks) from AnsuR is optimized for
both quickest transfer, least capacity requirement
and full quality high resolution of key elements,
even over unknown and unreliable channels.

management, damage assessment, surveillance,
situational awareness, qual ity management and
photo-journalism, where images are a bearer of
important and urgently required information.
AnsuR 's unique GR4-COMS protocol (Global
Rapid, Rel iable, Resilient, Robust Communications
Optimized for Mobile and Satellite) for IP systems
form an essential element in achieving universal
coverage, independence from local infrastructure
and consistent global performance.

OUTPUTS

Geo-referenced High Resolution Images in
near real time over unknown and potentially low
capacity satellite or mobile networks are essential
in many situations, such as disaster management,
survei llance, QA and photo journalism.

ASIGN
ASIGN is based in fundamental challenges in digital
communications. Requirements for communications
capacity increase substantially with higher resolution
image material. During disasters and emergencies,
remote areas of with reduced cellular or satellite coverage,
digital communications capacity may less than required.
Reliable system need to work always - anywhere, and
not just under "good enough" conditions. ASIGN from
AnsuR is the award-winning image communication
solution that solves this cha llenge optimally.
ASIGN utilizes a two-step approach with the AnsuR GR4COMS protocol. The first input is a form of preview; or "a
sign". Signs are shown in the server overview page. From
this an operator can, via a simple to use Web interface,
click on specific image pages and request any region of
interest in any quality from any image or video. It is even
possible to request best quality within a given time-limit.
During critical situations radio networks may congest.
Chances for congestion increase if multiple field teams

send sufficiently much high-resolution image material
without proper coordination. ASIGN in reality offers an
easy to use central control over how the system uses the
network resources, and significantly reduces the chances
of congestion.
The geo-reference allows simple integration with GIS
systems. By default Google maps and Openlayers are
used, but custom WMS servers can be integrated .
Satellite Earth Observation requires an in-situ component
for complementary observations and verifications. ASIGN
can be this in-situ component, and can also work with
various sensor data, offering access to high resolution
measurements from decimated initial inputs.
An Android smartphone version of ASIGN complements
the one with separate GPS+Camera+Wi-Fi+PC+Modem.
There are also ASIGN solutions for aeronautical platforms
such as UAV and microdrones.
