M56A1 “COYOTE”
Motorized Smoke Obscurant System - MMWP3 I
The M56A1 Coyote is a motorized
system mounted on an M1113
Expanded Capacity High Mobility
Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicle
(HMMWV). Equipped with a
Turbo-Charged 190 HP engine, the
M56A1 has a gross vehicle weight
of 10,500 lbs. This enables the
maneuver element to fully load
the M56 and still pull a trailer.
Operational Capabilities–
The M56A1 Smoke Generator consists
of three types of obscurant systems that can be operated
either simultaneously, or independently. The M56A1 provides 90
minutes of Visual, 30 minutes of Infrared (IR), and 30 minutes of Millimeter
Wave (MMW) obscuration without re-supply. A crew of two is required to
operate the M56A1. Dissemination can be either stationary or mobile, and one
platoon (six vehicles) can provide a large area of coverage.
When combined, the Visual, IR, and MMW screens can deny enemy
Reconnaissance, Intelligence Surveillance and Target Acquisition (RISTA)
devices critical information regarding troop strength, position, movement, and
prevent weapon system kills on our combat units.

provides 30 minutes of operation in either a stationary or mobile mode. A
vehicle load out consists of 8 disposable canisters, each filled with 30 lbs. of
pre-cut Carbon Fiber (CF). By incorporating a dual bank design, a continuous
mode is achievable for stationary missions by alternately reloading the two
banks with four new canisters every 15 minutes. A concept study to add the
MMW Module to an M58 “WOLF” is currently in process.
MMW Features - Real-time system monitoring maximizes mission success by
providing anti-CF jam sense and recovery, auto abort of problem canisters and
auto-recovery from most system failures. An overhead storage box was
incorporated into the Vehicle Cab to support Basic Load and BII storage to
facilitate a successful obscurant mission. The relocation of the AT4 and SAW

MMW Control Panel - MMW Control is integrated into the
existing M56 Control Panel, conveniently located in the
M56A1 Cab between the driver and operator. This enables
easy access by either, while providing safety for the two man
crew operating the system. Control of the MMW System is
via a single On/Off switch located on this panel. Mission
status is constantly available on the 3-digit LED display.
