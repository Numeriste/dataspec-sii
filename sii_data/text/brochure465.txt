Uses tCMS
W Labs' PSI Vislon system is able to deliver
real-time persistent wide area surveillance
imagery k a u w of the concise data structure
of the tCMS.

Process data close to source to make it
immediately usable by local or remote
users
tCMS data structure designed for realtime, reach-back and remote access

Ths tCMS is a robust spatial temporal
database that can handle the large amounts of
data generated by the PSI Vision system.
The tCMS stores the high-resolutionimagery in
a way that provides rapid and loglcal imagery
access to local or remote usem.

Stores multi-int concumnt spatial
temporal data
Optlmired for bandwldth constrained
data links quickly provides data that
is needed or requested by the user

-

The tCMS processes data at the source,
making it available and usable in real-time.

Integrates with existing PED infmtrudure
In addition to storing PSI Vision data the
tCMS can accommodate any multi-int spatialtemporal data and pmvide It In any output
form or formats required.

Accommodates all sensors or data
sources through its Encoder API
Decoder API outputs available in all formats

spatial-temparal ISR data

Whether the user is lmlor m t e and
needs to monitor widearea situations or
wishes to track multiplesmaller events, the
tCMS prevides the data you need,when
you need it,wherever you are.
