Overview

Technology
The system contains a full-feature Core 2 Duo PC
running Windows 7 and a state-of-the-art receiver
(designed by Winkelmann). The receiver uses an
analogue front end, combined with software filtering
and demodulation to provide the best combination of
fast scan speed and receiver performance.
This design enables the system to sweep extremely fast;
the software provides a wide range of analysis tools for
the detection and location of bugging devices.

The Raptor RXi is an ultra-fast-scanning
nter-surveillance
receiver for quickly detecting surveillance transmitters.
The Raptor scans from 1OkHz to 26GHz in under 4s,
detecting even the briefest pulsed transmissions.
Featuring a fast Core 2 Duo processor, its multiple
software tools and demodulators detect frequencyhopping, burst mode and spread spectrum devices as
well as analogue audio and video signals.
Two spectrum analyser windows allow the user to
simultaneously view the whole spectrum and zoom in
on individual frequencies. The 'Waterfall' display mode
gives an intuitive display of signals over time.
The Raptor is designed to allow 24hr continuous
monitoring of the radio spectrum to detect remotecontrolled devices. Using its built-in Ethernet port, the
Raptor can be operated remotely, allowing sites to be
continuously monitored without the need for a site visit.
Modern ultra wideband (UWB) spread spectrum devices
are challenging for a conventional receiver to detect. Its
optional integrated, dedicated UWB receiver allows the
Raptor to detect such devices easily.
The Raptor is a portable device, allowing reference scans
to be easily run in different areas of a building, operating
either from an internal rechargeable battery or an
external supply. Its integrated antenna system provides
excellent wideband performance from 1OkHz to 26GHz.
The Raptor can also be supplied with an external passive
omni-directional antenna which has amazing coverage
from below 20MHz to 26GHz. With nominal gains of OdBi
or higher over 99.5% of the frequency range.

The user interface has been carefully designed
to be simple and intuitive; the spectrum analyzer
display shows the entire spectrum in one graphical
window with the facility to zoom in on areas of
interest. A separate zoom window allows the user
to simultaneously look at areas of the spectrum in
high-resolution mode. Displays spectrum as a list or
graphically. Facility to compare lists or graphs sampled
in different locations, plus allows user to zoom over the
spectrum without any interruption at even 20MHz.

The Probe Search Window can be used with a Probe Antenna to find
the location of a suspect transmission.
The Probe Search gives a visual (and audible if required) reading of the
strength of a signal. Using an External Directional Antenna, this can be
used to locate the physical location of a transmitter. The Raptor RXi optional
accessory case contains a Directional Probe Antenna (right) which can be
used for this purpose. This Directional Probe Antenna is officially rated from
700MHz to 6GHz. In practice the Probe Antenna performs below 700MHz
and above 6GHz. (Other frequencies are available upon request - see
Product Codes on back page.)
