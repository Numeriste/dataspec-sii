Police, homeland security,
military and first responders
can now link video images with
real-time GPS location data.
GeoVision's On-Screen Display
(OS D) technology captures and
records GPS evidentiary data of
the location of any event.
GeoVision is the ideal GPS location capture tool
for law enforcement, military, homeland security,
transportation, surveillance, insurance, and field
and survey workers. Police vehicles and surveillance
for GeoVision
platforms
are
ideal
candidates

and power, a miniaturized video throughput device
that overlays position data onto any video signal.
With GeoVision the video now contains valuable
positional information that can be used with most
off-the shelf mapping
software or integrated with
Hidden Technology's CP2 mapping and Control
package.

In addition to overlaying data onto the video image,
GeoVision can simultaneously convert the GPS NMEA
data into a continuous audio stream that can be
recorded to any audio track, including the stereo audio
channels of video camcorders. The remaining audio
channel on the recorder can be used for voice annotation.
The audio output track, when decoded by
GeoVision, provides a synchronized GPS data stream
for location tracking using mapping software such as
Hidden Technology's CP2 Mapping and Control
software.
GeoVision's miniaturised module is highly configurable
and flexible and allows the user to select and position
data fields, customize the data format, enable the
audio data track, and optionally capture auxiliary
peripheral inputs (such as status of lights and
sirens).
GeoVision includes Windows based controller software
to configure and control all system settings. The utility
uploads all setting via the RS-232 serial port to
GeoVision's non-volatile memory. You can customise
on-screen displays to meet your exact operational
needs.
