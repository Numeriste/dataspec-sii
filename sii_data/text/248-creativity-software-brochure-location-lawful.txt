Turn compliance into competitive advantage
In addition to the commercial opportunity generated by location based services, increasing numbers of mobile
network operators worldwide are being obligated to install Location Infrastructure to meet government Location
Lawful Interception legislation. This infrastructure feeds data to government security service agencies.
Location Lawful Intercept is commonly regarded as being legislation that will inevitably be passed by every
government in the world. If operators anticipate it - and invest today in the location infrastructure – then they can
exploit this investment to deploy commercial location-based services that will give them competitive advantage.
