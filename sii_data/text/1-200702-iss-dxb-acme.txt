Viruses & malware can threaten IC
endpoints and service infrastructure
SIP MIME attachments are powerful tool for richer call ID
- vcard text, picture or video
Potential Trojan horse for viruses and worms to generalpurpose server-based voice platforms
_ SIP softswitch, IMS CSCF, SIP servers, app servers
_ SIP PBX
Sobig
_ SIP phones & PCs
Code Red

New endpoint vulnerabilities

Nimda

_ Embedded web servers - IP phones
_ Java apps – liability or asset? SQL

Identity theft can’t be
prevented entirely by technology
How do you know you are talking to Bank of America?
Web site techniques don’t work for IC
- work for many-one, not many-many
Solution requirements
– Authentication, access control
– Trust chains - pre-established technical & business relationships

Eavesdropping threat is over hyped
Less risk than email, who encrypts email?

_ Email is information rich (attachments), voice not
_ Email always stored on servers, only voice mail
_ Email always stored on endpoints, voice not

Who is at risk?

_ Bad guys - Osama, drug cartels,
pedophiles, etc.
_ Law enforcement
_ Money, love, & health-related
– insider trading, adultery, ID theft,

Solution requirements

_ Authentication – subscriber
_ End-to-end encryption (EXPENSIVE)
• Signaling (TLS, IPSec)
• Media (SRTP, IPSec)

SPIT will be annoying,
& possible tool for ID theft
Will anonymous, cheap Yahoo subscriber (aka SPITTER)
be able to call money-paying Verizon subscriber to solicit
- phone sex, penis enlargement, Viagra pill purchase?

Access control – static
Content filtering
Charging - $/call
Regulation

Solution requirements

_ Access control
– dynamic, IDS-like
_ Authentication
_ Admission control
– subscriber limits (#)
_ Trust chains - pre-established
technical & business relationships

Who is responsible for security?
The individual

The organization

The future IC net?

The Internet

Acme Packet Net-Net SD “flawlessly passed
all of CT Labs’ grueling attack tests”
Total of 34 different test cases, using over 4600 test scripts
No failed or dropped calls, even for new calls
made during attacks
No lost RTP packets during attacks
Protected the service provider equipment – did not
allow flood attacks into core, stopped packets at edge
SD performance not impacted during attack
– SD CPU utilization - only
10% increase
– Signaling latency - only
2 ms average increase
– RTP jitter – less
than 1 ms increase
(not measurable by
test equipment)

Acme Packet SBC
DoS/DDoS protection
Network processor (NPU) -based protection
– L3/4 (TCP, SYN, ICMP, etc.) & signaling attack detection & prevention – Dynamic & static ACLs (permit & deny) to SPU
– Trusted & untrusted paths to SPU w/configurable bandwidth allocation &
bandwidth policing per session
– Trusted devices - guaranteed signaling rates & access fairness
– Untrusted devices – can access unused
trusted bandwidth
Security
– Separate queues for ICMP, ARP, telnet, etc.

– Reverse Path Forwarding (uRPF)

– Overload prevention - 10 Gbps
