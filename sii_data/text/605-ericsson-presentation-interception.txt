authorisation file so that you can only
connect to particular network elements and
send them particular commands. You can
view permitted network elements and
commands.

© Ericsson Interception Management Systems, 2000

CELLNET Drop 2

30

3.7 Sending commands to network elements
• You send all commands to a network element
from the command input box.
• The network element returns all responses –
whether immediate printout (IPO) or delayed
result printout (RPO) – to the printout box.

© Ericsson Interception Management Systems, 2000

CELLNET Drop 2

31

3.8 To edit and re-send a command sent
previously
• Find the command in the history list and click it
only once. The command copies to the command
input box.
• Edit the command as required and press Return to
send it. When the IPO Window button is visible,
an immediate response appears in the printout box.
The command also appends to the history list
regardless if any changes have been made.

© Ericsson Interception Management Systems, 2000

CELLNET Drop 2

32

3.9 To immediately re-send a command
sent previously
• Find the command in the history list and doubleclick it.
• WiOZ Communication Tool sends the command
immediately without copying it to the command
input box. When the IPO Window button is
visible, an immediate response appears in the
printout box. The command does not append to
the history list compare with ‘To edit and resend a
command sent previously’ above.

3.10 Entry Commands and Sub
Commands
• Entry command is a command which
establishes a session with the specified
Support Processor Group (SPG) for various
sub-system.
• It enables the operator to subsequently enter
sub-commands which are executed in the
SPG.

CELLNET Drop 2

35

3.10 To step through a command file – in
sequence
• You must create command files before you can
send any to a network element – see.
• This method only lets you send commands in
strict sequence from first to last. And you can only
see one command at a time.

© Ericsson Interception Management Systems, 2000

CELLNET Drop 2

36

3.11 To step through a command file – out of
sequence
• You must create command files before you
can send any to a network element.
• This method lets you see all the commands
in a command file before you begin sending
them.
• You can also send them in any order.

© Ericsson Interception Management Systems, 2000

CELLNET Drop 2

37

3.12 Handling the output from network
elements
• If the IPO window is currently being
displayed, the RPO indicator at the top right
will illuminate when WiOZ Communication
Tool receives a result printout (RPO).
• You can then switch the printout box to
view the contents of the RPO.

© Ericsson Interception Management Systems, 2000

CELLNET Drop 2

38

3.13 To view either immediate or result
printouts (IPO or RPO)

• The button changes to ‘RPO Window’ and
the printout box displays the delayed RPO
buffer.
• Click the RPO Window button in the WiOZ
– Communication Terminal window.
• The button changes to ‘IPO Window’ and
the printout box displays the IPO buffer.
© Ericsson Interception Management Systems, 2000

CELLNET Drop 2

39

3.14 To end a lengthy printout
prematurely
• Acknowledgement responses in the immediate
printout (IPO) buffer are usually short.
• Result printouts (RPO) can be lengthy and you
may wish to cut them short.
• Click the Break button in the WiOZ –
Communication Terminal window.
• The response in the printout box ends immediately
when viewing either the IPO or
• RPO buffer.
© Ericsson Interception Management Systems, 2000

CELLNET Drop 2

40

3.15 To save all or part of session
printouts to log files
• You may save all or part of the printout box
to a log file.
• You can save only the immediate printout
(IPO) or only the Result printout (RPO), or
you have been switching auto logging on
and off, and need to save the entire session.

© Ericsson Interception Management Systems, 2000

CELLNET Drop 2

41

3.16 To delete the contents of the
printout box
• You may want to start with a clean printout
box, especially if you wish to save a record
of a new session of commands and
responses.
• Right-click in the printout box and choose
the Clear Window menu option.

© Ericsson Interception Management Systems, 2000

CELLNET Drop 2

42

3.17 Working with the history list
• When you send a man-machine language (MML)
command to a network element, WiOZ Communication
Tool appends the command to the history list.
• As you send commands, WiOZ Communication Tool
appends them to the top of the history list box, that is, the
earliest command is at the bottom and the latest at the top.
The line numbers show you the order and help you keep
track when resending commands.
• When you save the history list to a command file, the file is
ordered as you would expect – earliest commands at the
beginning and latest commands at the end.
© Ericsson Interception Management Systems, 2000

CELLNET Drop 2

43

3.18 Working with command files
• Command files consist of a series of man-machine
language (MML) statements, one to a line, in the same
syntax as you would type them in the command input box.
• In a command file, the first command to execute is at the
‘top’ or beginning of the file and the last to execute is at the
‘bottom’ or end.
• When you open a command file in the history list, WiOZ
Communication Tool reverses the displayed order.
• The line numbers tell you which are earlier or later. Keep
these differences in mind when you are creating and
editing command files.
© Ericsson Interception Management Systems, 2000

CELLNET Drop 2

44

3.19 To save the history list to a
command file
• Right-click in the history list and choose the
Save To CmdFile menu option.
The File Selection Box dialogue opens at
the default directory for command files.
You may navigate to a different directory if
you wish.
• Type the name for the new command file
and click OK.

3.20 To create new command files

© Ericsson Interception Management Systems, 2000

CELLNET Drop 2

46

3.21 To edit command files
• A command file is just an ordinary ASCII text file.
So you may prefer another editor, such as Text
Editor. Or you may use a traditional UNIX editor,
such as vi or emacs.

© Ericsson Interception Management Systems, 2000

CELLNET Drop 2

47

3.22 To open or import existing
command files
• Consider clearing the current contents of the Edit
Command File window.
• A file does not open into a new window. Instead, WiOZ
Communication Tool inserts the file at the location of the
insertion point in the current window.
• Choose the File > New menu option to start with an empty
window.

© Ericsson Interception Management Systems, 2000

CELLNET Drop 2

48

3.23 To end an editing session
• CAUTION No warning of unsaved file
WiOZ Communication Tool does not warn
you if you quit the Edit Command File
window while its contents are unsaved.
• Choose the File > Save menu option and
save the contents of the Edit Command
File window if not already saved.
• Choose the File > Quit menu option.
© Ericsson Interception Management Systems, 2000

CELLNET Drop 2

49

3.24 Managing command files
• You may use the File Manager of the Common Desktop
Environment (CDE) to copy, rename, and move command
files. See the Common Desktop Environment.
• CAUTION Deleted files are gone forever Once you
delete a command file the only way you might
be able to recover it is if the system
administrator can restore it from a back-up
tape.

CELLNET Drop 2

50

3.25 Working with session log files
• Log files are a permanent record of the commands
sent to a network element and its responses as
displayed in the printout box.
• They are useful when you are developing
command files and you need a record of the
interactions with an network element for
debugging.
• Log files can be an audit trail during network
operations to record how the behaviour of the
network is altered.

The audit function can be used to obtain these
details:
• what interceptions have been initiated for a
particular network element or group of network
elements.
• which network elements or groups of network
elements are actively intercepting calls.
• which subscribers are the targets of interceptions.

© Ericsson Interception Management Systems, 2000

CELLNET Drop 2

59

4.7 Synchronise the IMS & NE
Database
• Synchronising forces the specified network
elements to be updated based on the audit
report contents.
• The IMS Database is assumed to be correct,
hence all activation in the network elements
are synchronised to be consistent with the
IMS Database.

7.1 XMATE Monitor
• The XMATE monitor is used to control these
servers:
– Information Handling Server (IHS)
– Data Communication Server (DCS)
– File Transfer Server (FTS)

• IHS and DCS must be active for all XMATE
functions
• FTS must be active if file transfers are to be
performed.
• The monitor is used to activate, deactivate, and
examine all of the servers that are on the network.

7.2 Server Configuration
• XMATE can be configured in many
ways, either standalone with IHS,
DCS, and FTS all running on the
same machine, or over a network,
with the four servers running on
different machines. On a network,
there may be multiple DCS and FTS
servers.
• Only one IHS server per XMATE system
should run. This handles all alarms

7.12 Network Element Setup
• The Network Element Setup U/I enables the
XMATE System Administrator to configure
the NetWork Map (NWM). Configuring the
NWM involves defining Network Elements
(NEs) for one or more Data Communication
gateways (DCSs). The NWM contains
information of an XMATE system domain
comprising: DCS gateways, NEs and their
characteristics.
