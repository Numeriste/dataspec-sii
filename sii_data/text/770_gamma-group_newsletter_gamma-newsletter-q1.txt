MONITORING CENTER FOR LAWFUL INTERCEPTION
Gamma Group international is a reputable monitoring system integrator for GSM/3G networks. lts
Monitoring Center (MC) is a system designed ta enable Law EnforcementAgencies (LEA) and government
agencies ta perform Lawful Interception (LI) monitoring in an auditable, secure and reliable manner.
lt handles intercepts of voice and data in fixed and mobile networks, on the internet or other IP networks.
Within the two general forms of intercept, voice and data, it manages a wide range of communication
methods.
The system installations can vary in size from a few computers ta an extensive system of many recorders,
data collectors, system servers and clients, depending on the application. lts complexity ranges from
simple passive connection, ta a single trunk line, to being responsible for monitoring an entire country's
fixed, mobile, NGN and internet networks.
Sophisticated user-rights and access contrai mechanisms have been designed ta meetthe organizational
needs of Law Enforcement and Government Agencies.
The implementation is not rigid and these mechanisms can be used ta su it most organizational structures
and variations within the ETSI standards. The mechanisms also build upon the MS Windows environment
ta offer a se cure but flexible application.
The system performs these monitoring and management tasks from a scalable, distributable and reliable
platform with facilities ta ensure the security of the system and intercepted data. lts architecture is
modular, which allows systems ta be built and scaled as appropriate to the customer's needs.
The Monitoring Center supports a wide-range of fixed and mobile switches, internet ISP and backbone
interception points, NGN networks and mobile IP. lt can decode fax and loca l loop internet from circuit
switched networks and ail popular internet protocols from IP networks.
Through add-on product interfaces, the MC offers its data for further ana lysis and intelligence extraction.
lt is currently in use in more than 60 countries.

The FinFly ISP System is designed to remotely install the Remote Monitoring Solution (e.g. FinSpy) on
selected Target Computer Systems by integrating the system into an ISP's IP-network infrastructure.
Optional FinFly ISP Addons include IP Shaping and Blocking.
A FinFly ISP System typically consists of the following Appliances and Functional Groups:
A) Target Infection Server(s)
• FinFly ISP Infection Proxy Server
B) Target Identification Server(s)
• FinFly ISP Target Identification Probe/ RADIUS/ DHCP Probe
C) Management System
• FinFly ISP Management Server
• FinFly ISP Management Workstation
D) Network Equipment
• Bypass Switch Function, Switches, Passive Taps, 19" Server Rack(s), UPS etc .

L__. ·---·-------·- -----------------·-----·----------

f h1Ffy ISP Management System

The FinFly ISP System is managed centrally from the LEA's premises using the FinFly ISP Management
System.
The user will administer targets for infection by entering the appropriate target data via the easyto-use GUI on the Management Workstation. The Management Server will distribute the necessary
commands to the FinFly ISP RADIUS Probes and Infection Proxies deployed in ISP's network.
A Target is added to the FinFly ISP system using its access data-like "dial-in phone no." or "username".
ln case the target has a fixed IP-Address this IP-Address will be entered into the system. ln this
specific case the RADIUS Probes are not involved in the Target Identification process.

IP MONITORING
FinLI is a Front-End system to capture IP data from IP networks according to the requirements of
Lawful Interception (LI) or Intelligence Monitoring (IM). lt provides the captured IP data to the Law
Enforcement Monitoring Facilities (LEMF) - Monitoring Center - according to several international
standards like ETSI and CALEA (and sorne other formats).
The IP Probe components are based on high -end standard server technology and are deployed in the
IP network (ISP network) using passive tapping devices to ensure working with a 100% copy of the
complete IP traffic without interfering with the network itself. This last point is always a major concern
for network operators.
By using a wide range of sophisticated filtering rnethods, realized with Deep Packet Inspection, Fin LI can
provide the target and/or app lic ation data needed. LI implements many different Target Identific ation
procedures, like RADIUS dialog sniffing or active communication with the AAA-Servers in the access
network to identify the targets of interest currently active in the network.
For Intelligence Monitoring, which is not target based, but related to Application Monitoring (e.g.
identifying and recording of Webmail traffic or specific files transferred vi a the Internet), the Target
Identification is not an issue. ln this case, the IP Probes will inspect the traffic bit by bit to id entify
applications and files and then will provide the data, in addition to the source and destination addresses,
to the Monitoring Center for storage, archiving and evaluation.

LAWFUL INTERCEPTIO N
Lawful Interception (LI) is the legally approved
surveillance of telecommunications services, and
has become an importanttool for law enforcement
agencies (LEAs) around the world for investigating
and prosecuting criminal activities and terrorism.
Most countries have passed laws that require
telecommunications service providers to
support LEAs with duly authorized requests
to identify, monitor, and deliver ail electronic
communications of specified individuals and
groups. While regulations and requirements
vary from country to country, international and
American standardization bodies like ETSI or
ANSI have developed technical standards for
LI that will facilitate the work of LEAs and help
operators and service providers to minimize
their costs. Although various standards for LI use
different terminology, the basic functional model
applies to ail LI standards and to all network and
service types.

The main functions of any LI solution are to
access lnterception-Related Information (IRI)
and Content of Communications (CC) from the
telecommunications network and to deliver the
information in a standardized format via the
handover interface to one or more monitoring
centers of law enforcement agencies. Of course,
before surveillance can take place, interception
requests must be approved and appropriately
provisioned to the Interception Access Points
within the service provider's network, and they
must be carefully and accurately terminated after
the interception authorization expires. ln addition,
high security requirements for LI systems are
essential to prevent possible manipulation and
misuse.

PASSIVE A-INTERFACE MONITORING FOR GSM NETWORKS,
PASSIVE MONITORING OF ENTIRE GSM NETWORK
The A interface between the MSC (Mobile Switching Center) and BSC (Base Station Controller)
consists of El or STM-1 trunks. The System solution monitors TOM.
A-Interface links between BSCs and an MSC. lt detects calls and text messages on these links
and captures IRI and uncompressed G.711 A-Law or µ-Law aud io associated with the intercepts.
Monitoring of A-Interfaces may be implemented with PDH (64 duplex El) or SDH gateways (2 x STM-1 ).
ln future, we will also support direct Ethernet interfaces. A deployment unit may be used to monitor
more than one A-Interface and a number of SS7 links at the same time. The A-Interface solution
assumes that TMSls are also unique within the context of a Location Area Code (LAC) and that
the LACs are unique with the context of the PLMN identity. ln cases where TM Sis are not unique,
different name spaces can be configured . lt may not be necessary to monitor ail links between an
MSC and its sub-tended BSCs.
The A-Interface monitoring solution is illustrated in the following diagram .

WI RELESS LOCATOR SYSTEM (WLS ) FOR GSM/UMTS NETWORKS
WLS is the on ly techno logy that provides high -accuracy mobile location across ai l types of
environments in a highly sca lab le and cost-effective way. The easy-to-deploy, easy-to -manage
solution provides LI applications with the precise location of mobile devices to accuracy within 50
meters, and gives Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) rea l-time, post-event, geo -fenced and even
predictive intelligence using mass Location capabi lities.
The Wireless Locator has the following applications:

TARGET-BASED LO CATION
INTERCEPTION
Adding high-accuracy location information to
target-based interception allows LEAs to
monitor fleeing suspects in real-time and track
a historical "bread -crumb trai l" of the wire less
activity of a specific user. The highly-accurate
WLS solution can pinpoint the location of mobile
devices to the exact building.
~

\ ,1•
~-~"'""'

MASS LOCATIO N INTERCEPTION
WLS is the only location technology that enables
accurate mass location of ail devices on a mobile
network. Mass location is especially helpful for
post-event analytics based on historica l archived
data, identifying all wire less activity in an area
over a set period of time. This gives LEAs critical
investigative information about suspects after an
event - such as a bomb going off - including who
was present, who they were talking to and what
they did in the immediate aftermath.

BORD ER-ZONE LOCATION
INTERCEPTION
Border-zone location interception allows an
electronic virtua l fence to be set up around a high
security area or an internationa l border, allowing
LEAs to track the location of wireless devices that
travel in and out of the area. The accuracy of the
WLS so lution ensures that precise locations are
identified along the border zone, preventing even
marginal incursions.

3GN IMSI CATCHER

F'F"

'""!

3G Blind Cali is a new software feature for the
3GN UMTS system. lt allows 3G phones to be
locked to the 3GN and placed in a UMTS blind/
silent call for tracking purposes. This is the
only way to establish blind calls to phones that
are set in "3G only" mode, and it removes the
reliance on passing the 3G phone to a GSM
system for tracking - the target phone stays
on 3G frequencies at ail times. The 3G -OF can
detect and track the signal from a 3G phone in a
blind call, allowing the OF operator to loc ate it.

• Multiple 3G blind calls can be supported by each 3GN Node B
• Automatic 3G power contrai ensures that Node B and phone TX power are continually adjusted
to optimal levels to maintain the blind call
• The 3GN can continue to take registrations from other 3G phones whilst maintaining a blind call
to the target phone
JG Direction Finder Features:
• Provides indication of target RSCP (Received Signal Code Power) to en able operator to judge
distance and bearing to target
• Features gra phical and audio feedback of currenttarget RSCP level for ease of use in

XPZ WIRELESS IP
The XPZ is normally controlled by a Cat 5 cable that connects the laptop to the XPZ.
We can provide you with our secure wireless IP connection instead of the cable connection, enabling
remote controlling of the XPZ from a safe remote location.
This is possible in different ways:
RF units
• Four channels enabling four links to ope rate in the sa me area
• Secure wireless Link
• Output power of lOOmW
• Simple to deploy and contains a battery (typically last for 2 hours)
• Range extensions by deploying additional units
High Powered Wi Fi units
• Longer range
• High output 10-20W
• lncorporate 3G Router
COFDM MESH units
• Diversity reception to gre atly enhance the range; copes better with multi path condition s
• MESH Network could be linked to www by sec ure 3G router/VPN or satellite connection

The RF unit can be used on four channels
enabling, if necessary, four links to operate ;
in the same area.
The Cat 5 cable can be replaced by a sec ure
wireless link. The RF units only have an
output power of 100mW so the range is
limited but may be more than adequate in
some operational scenarios. Naturally, the
range can be extended with the use of the
appropriate aerials and choice of frequency
band. The units are very simple to deploy and
contain a battery which would typically last
for two hours.

COMPACT AUDIO SURVEILLANCE
FLUORESCENT LIGHT SYSTEM
The unit is a unique audio surveillance device
capable of operating in hostile environments
where the target utilizes TSCM sweep teams
to clear the area of "bugs". lt utilizes a unique
optical communications link capable of standoff distances of 100m/109yds. Installation merely
requires the insertion of the surveillance lamp in
the target room. With power applied via the lamp's
socket, it collects room audio and transmits it via
the optical link to the remote optical receiver.
Typical 100m/109yds operating range is limited
only by line of sight conditions and environmental
ambient lighting such as sun light or bright street

Computer Forensics is the function of utilising
scientifically proven methods to assemble
together and process data found on a digital
device, (computer, hard disk drive, mobi le
