Mini Shadow LP
Room Jammer
Mini Shadow is a compact jamming system which can be wall
mounted in rooms and around a building to provide complete
protection.
Each Jamming module can be remotely controlled and radiates
multiple programmable jamming carriers that can
instantaneously jam selected frequency bands.
The modular design enables the system to be fitted to jam the
required threat frequencies while being easily maintained by
personnel in the field.
Anti-tamper features make the Mini Shadow ideal for installation
in secure facilities such as prisons and detention centers.

Preventing the use of mobile phones and communications devices in Prisons and Secure Facilities is
an important part of security and crime prevention. The Mini Shadow LP 'Cell-block™' system is a
comprehensive communications device jamming system.

Equipment
Designed and manufactured in the UK. The equipment is suitable for fitting into Prisons/ Jails or
Secure Buildings to give protection against unauthorised use of mobile phones and other mobile
communications devices. The jammers are wall mounted or free standing with universal power
supply.
A full range of integrated efficient antennas are provided in the system to ensure the maximum
energy is transmitted into the required area. These antenna are designed and built in the UK and
installed as part of a turnkey solution. An optional battery backup facility can also be offered to
provide one hour of use without power from the mains.
A wide selection of frequency bands are selectable by the customer depending on country and
local operator networks. Each jammer is remote controlled by the 'Sentinel' monitor and control
software application.
Wide band Cell-block Jammer System.
Mini Shadow LP Cell-block Jammer units can be powered from mains power or PoE. Control is
provided from RS232/USB, Ethernet or WiFi. For mobile phones and communications devices a
single Mini Shadow system can jam the following popular bands:
GSM-850,
E-GSM-900,
DCS-1800,
PCS-1900,
UMTS-2100,
WiFi 2.4G

All Ce/1-blockTM jammer modules have options to adjust frequency and power to ensure only the
mobile networks in the area are jammed. The system can be optimized to keep the transmission
from each jammer to a minimum while maintaining full effect.
Detectors may be supplied at various locations to monitor RF activity in dedicated bands. Upon
detection of activity the Detector activates the Cell-block jammer. Once activated the jammer will
transmit for a set duration. Upon secession the Detector immediately checks for RF activity again
and the process repeats.
