GSM-Monitoring System Semi Active – Falcon E+

Description
The Falcon E+ system is designed and developed as a Semi Active OFF-THE-AIRGSM-Monitoring system. The system provides the option of both stationary and
mobile operation
The Falcon E+ system deciphers A5.1 and A5.2 ciphering algorithms online. The
system does not require the service providers SIM for operation because uses
cloning of the targets phone in real time. Therefore, all the calls made by the target
are billed into its account

Main Features
•

The system ensures monitoring of audio and data traffic within standard GSM
900/1800 networks (800/1900 on request) and deciphers A5.1 and A5.2 algorithms
online

•

Default configuration of the system – 8 or 12 reception channels (4 or 6 duplex
channels, monitoring of both forward and reverse conversation channels)

•

The system ensures registration of radio-electronic-conditions within the radio cells
to be monitored (frequency and characteristics of BCCH-channels)

•

The operator can select the required targets based on their IMSI or IMEI. Upon
selecting the targets the system acts as a virtual base station (BTS) for these
targets.

•

When one of the targets initiates a call, the FALCON E+ system automatically
calculates the ciphering key ant authentications parameters. These parameters are
then cloned onto another mobile phone attached to the system (up to 4). The
targets calls are now routed through the cloned mobile phone, maintaining the
same encryption and target identity.

•

The system contains a database (up to 1000 calling partners), operating in real-time,
which can be accessed corresponding to the selected search criteria and
parameters.

•

Calling partners are identified according to the IMEISV, IMSI, TMSI, ISDN number
(local and international number)

•

Retrieving of target IMEI/IMSI for using targets mobile number and silent call

•

Registration and storage of telephone conversations, call related information,
network information and Short Message Service (SMS) to the system`s hard disk.

•

The system ensures registration and storage as audio codec – types FR, EFR, HR.

•

Playback of recordings may be carried out by the system itself

•

Identification of SMS and DTMF data.
