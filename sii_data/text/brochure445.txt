Value-Add Solution

LI for Specific Court Orders

Packet Forensics adds value and
reduces costs and installation challenges
by using a unified hardwarelsoftware
solution. This approach eliminates the
expense of traditional systems that
require separate lAPs and mediation
devices, and integrates these functions
into one streamlined system. This
approach also avoids back-haul of
data from edge collection probes back
inside the core to mediation and then
out again to the LEA. Management and
maintenance of the single device is also
greatly simplified to save time and
reduce steps to comply with time-critical
intercept orders.

Unlike many competitive solutions,
Packet Forensics' surveillance software
goes beyond identifying voice traffic and
gives it the special handling it deserves.
instead of delivering a data intercept
containing voice, our solution uses the
proper mediation methodology and
delivery protocol to treat voice intercepts

differently than data intercepts. Packet
Forensics supports pen-register,
trap-and-trace, and f u l l content voice
intercepts complete with dialed digit
extraction. This affords YOU the most
specific f o r m of compliance while
doing the best Job of upholding the
privacy of Your constituents.
