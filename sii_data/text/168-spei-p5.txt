The P5 is a highly integrated device dedicated to the environmental silent monitoring.
The voice section has two separate fully programmable audio path in terms of volume using SMS or simply by a DTMF
keypad (for example you may use the same telephone making the call)
It may be battery operated or directly connected to the same vehicle supply.
The P5 operations may be triggered by the operator (SMS/DTMF) or automatically when any movement has been
detected.
The device is designed to operate with one external microphone (Ø 2.5 mm) connected by a very resistant cable
(length: 1.5 m or more on request).
The GSM antenna is connected via SMA RF connector.
Finally, the enclosure – made in aluminium, passivated - offers adequate protection against dust, water and withstands to most of other environmental conditions.

The GSM section performs a set of telecom services (TS) according to GSM standard phase 2+, ETSI and ITU-T. it is compliant with GSM phase 2/2+
The functions of the module are implemented by issuing Hayes AT commands as
detailed in GSM specs level 07.05/07.07
SMS are sent and received accordingly to MO/MT, GSM07.05, PDU and text
mode.
Data is transferred at 9600 bps (CSD)
GPRS is a multislot Class 10, mobile station protocol class B.
Automatic hand-over between GSM 900 and GSM 1900
GSM 900, E-GSM 900 and GSM 1800
> -105dB
Class 4: 2W per GSM 900
Class 2: 1W per GSM 1800
