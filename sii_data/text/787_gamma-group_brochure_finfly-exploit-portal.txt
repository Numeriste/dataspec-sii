Usage Example 1: High-Tech Crime Unit

Usage Example 2: Intelligence Agency

A High-Tech Crime Unit was investigating a Cyber-Crime
and needed to deploy a Remote Monitoring Solution on
a Target System . They used an Adobe Acrobat Reader
0-Day Exploit and sent a prepared PDF file via Email to the
Target. The Remote Monitoring Solution was automatical ly
deployed once the Target opened the file.

A Target was identified within a Discussion Board but no
direct or Email contact was possible. The Agency created a
Webserver containing an Internet Explorer 0-day Exploit
which deployed the Payload on the Target System once the
Target opened the URL that was sent to him through a
private message in the Discussion Board .
