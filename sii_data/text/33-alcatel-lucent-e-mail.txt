Work on replacing out-of-date analog system equipment with modern digital
communications system is currently underway as part of the general plan
for modernization of the national communications network. Over the past
several years, more than 20 digital telephone stations have been installed
in Turkmenistan. This has increased the availability of telephone numbers
by 100,000. Two German companies, Siemens and Alcatel, are carrying out
the largest telephone network upgrading projects. A project to construct
708 kilometers of the Trans Asian-European fiberoptic communications line
(TAE) within the boundaries of Turkmenistan was completed in 1997 by the
Iranian National Telecommunications Company. The German company Siemens
supplied most of the equipment for this project. Siemens has also supplied
GSM equipment for about 5,000 phone numbers to Texas-based Barash
Communication Technologies, Inc. The exclusive cellular and paging
communications service provider is currently negotiating several
additional contracts with the communications ministry. The government
plans a gradual upgrade of the existing communications network by
replacing it with a digital communications system, building new trunk
communications lines, and developing new international communications
channels.
