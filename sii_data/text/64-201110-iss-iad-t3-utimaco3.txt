Data Preservation vs. Data Retention
 Data Preservation (aka. ‘quick freeze’)
Is applied only from the moment a suspicion arises
A Preservation order is issued with respect to a particular person
 Data Retention
Is key to investigate events prior to the moment when a criminal
suspicion arises
Guarantees availability of historical data linked to current investigation
case
Gathers all relevant communication records, suspicious or not
