1 TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION OF THE DRONE
The drone is characterised by a reticular airframe, completely realised by full carbon fiber
tubes and plates. This airframe has been completely designed and calculated by our
technical office, having the following technical specifications:
damping of the vibration frequencies of the engines: in order to reduce the
influence on the sensors transported;
low request for maintenance: fixing of the components using mechanical joints
instead of screws;
low influence of the wind during the flight: due to a very low lateral shape;
lightweight: with the aim to reach higher time of flight and dynamic performances:
high power/ weight ratio: use of very powerful engines towards the light weight of
the ready-to-fly machine, in order to reach a very high contrai authority in
presence of wind;
high adaptability to various commercial components;
ability to land and take off from slopped surfaces (up to 30° from the horizontal
level), in manual flight control, with a dedicated configuration of the drone;
design, construction of the components, assembling and test completely realised
in our own head office ;
possibility to make the drone rain proof upon request from the customer.

PAVLOAD DESCRIPTION
Standardised mechanical and electrical interface for every payload;
Easy, fast and precise changing of the payload on the drone by quick connectors
and two screws.
Automatic stabilization of the payload platform by using onboard electronic contrai
(completely designed and developed by our technical office);

Completely remotable pitch and roll payload: the yaw contrai is realised rotating
the UAV;
Pitch and roll movements completely driven on bearings;
Full carbon fiber and aluminium construction;
Built-in landing gear;
Regulation capability of the mounting position of the transported sensors on the
payload platf orm;
Design, construction, assembling and testing are all realised in our head office.
