PACE
PROTOCOL & APPLICATION CLASSIFICATION ENGINE
ipoque's Protocol and Application Classification Engine (PACE) uses a combination of deep packet inspection (DPI)
technologies, including pattern matching, behavioral and statistical analysis, to reliably detect protocols even if they use
advanced obfuscation and encryption techniques. It helps network equipment and software vendors to enhance their
products with powerful and proven layer-7 protocol management capabilities. PACE has been optimized for performance and classification reliability. It is highly flexible and can be integrated in any existing platform such as firewalls,
network security appliances and lawful interception systems.

APPLICATION SCENARIOS
Next-Generation Firewalls &
WAN Optimization Controllers (WOC)
Reliably classify network protocols and apqlications, independent of TCP and UDP ports, for
network access control
Traffic Analysis, Accounting & Billing Systems
Collect detailed statistics based on actual
protocol and application usage for network
resource planning, billing and accounting

Bandwidth Management
Network bandwidth management t o provide
quality of service (QoS) i n fixed-line and mobile
networks with per-protocol and per-application
bandwidth priorities, guarantees and caps
Lawful Interception
Reliably classify intercepted traffic for negative
and positive filtering, protocol-based load balancing and improved post-processing

ADVANCED DEEP PACKET INSPECTION ENGINE
PACE is a software library which detects and classifies protocols and applications from a network packet stream. It uses o wide range of deep packet
inspection (DPI) technologies, including pattern matching, behavioral,
statistical and heuristic analysis. Based on this combination, PACE is able
t o reliably detect proprietary, encrypted and obfuscated protocols with a
very low false negative rate and virtually no false positives.
PACE - Beyond Protocol Detection
Sub-protocol detection allows to differentiate between various connection types initiated by the same application, such as audio, file transfer,
encrypted and unencrypted
Symmetric and asymmetric traffic detection
Decapsulatestunneling protocols with arbitrary encapsulation depth
Statistical traffic measurements: TCP SYN to SYN/ACK and SYNIACK t o
ACK round-trip time measurement, TCP out-of-order counter
RTP performance rneosurements provide jitter and packet loss
information
Metadata extraction for HTTP, SIP and SSL in real time
RTP flows are optionally correlated with the corresponding protocol that
initioted them (e.g. SIP, MSN, Yahoo)
Low-impact signature upgrade by flow state preservation before reboot
Custom Protocol Definition
Custom Protocol Definitions allow t o extend the PACE signature database with a combination of the following additional layer-4 and layer-7
criteria:
Layer-4 protocol (i.e.TCP, UDP)
Layer-4 ports (lists and ranges of source ond destination ports)
Layer-7 protocol
HTTP host list or URL list for HTTP-based layer-7 protocols
Traffic direction (i.e. inbound, outbound)

Less than 2,000 CPU cycles on average per complete
protocol detection
Less than 1,000 CPU cycles on average per flow forthe built-in flow
trocking code
Fastpath implementatiori that analyzes only as much packets per flow
OS necessary for a reliable protocol detection; later packets simply pass
by the detection engine saving valuable CPU resources
Memory Footprint
392 bytes per flow
816 bytes per network user or subscriber
50 kbytes for initializotion data structures
The entire memory is allocated a t initialization. During packet processing,
PACE does not dynamically allocate any memory.

FLEXIBLE INTEGRATION IN ANY TARGET PLATFORM
Runs on virtually any hardware orchitecture with at least 32-bit processor and C compiler
Can be used as a dynamic or static library in user space or as a kernel
module in kernel spoce
32-bit & 64-bit compatible
Little & big endian architectures
Runs on any Linux and Windows environments
100% proprietary code provides clean licensing without CPL compliance
Issues
Optional CPL-compliant Linux Netfilter wrapper for user space
operation
Integrated connection/session tracking engine; existing implementations can also be used

FIELD-PROVEN &WIDELY DEPLOYED
HIGHLY OPTlMlZED IMPLEMENTATION
Performance
Developed entirely in C
High throughput for deployment in core network links
operating a t speeds of 10 Cbit/s and beyond
Integrated highly optimized flow tracking for millions of concurrent
connections

PACE is the heart of ipoque's PRXTraffic Manager and DPX Network Probe
with over 2 0 0 installations in more than 50 countries across the globe.
PACE has also been successfully integrated in third-party firewalls, WAN
optimization controllers, lawful interception systems and 3C/4C mobile
network data gateway systems.
