TVC 4000

••

The TVC 4000 , a universal communications in-vehicle server, with an
architecture to support a range of devices all displaying a common array
of functions , enabled by the Terrafix TVC cloud. The principle of the TVC
cloud is to provide a common but flexible platform for all customers
such as the Emergency Services , Police and Security Agencies alike
with a range of software applications.
The 'cloud ' provides the user with the ability to transfer information ,
over a number of devices including Apple , Android , Windows based
or Terrafix bespoke , all in a powerful comparable way, irrelevant of
which platform is to be used.

The TVC 4000 acting as a vehicle server, creates a secure information cloud
which provides a cost effective, and flexible approach to information distribution.
Vehicles installed with a TVC 4000 can act as a 'Hot Zone' tor devices to gather
or distribute data over more than one bearer.

SAMS [Situation Awareness Mobile SystemsJ

•

Terrafix have developed SAMS, an asset tracking and management system, providing
a flexible system to work as a stand alone GSM/ OMO (Direct Mode Operation)
system , or part of an infrastructure network GPRS/ TMO (Trunk Mode Operation).
SAMS will utilise the GPS in a variety of devices i.e. Terrafix TVC 4000, iPad,
iPhone, Android or Windows Mobile .
Using the Terrafix mapping platform, SAMS enables the user to have full visibility of all the assets, allowing
them to manage more effectively and improve operational efficiency. Using the Configuration Manager
application, the operator is able to control who is capable of seeing groups of assets.

TerraTRACK CSecureJ

•••

Terrafix have a flexible system which offers all of the facilities expected from covert surveillance communities, such as
tracking , replay, geofences, and analytical report generation. The infrastructure is such that the system can meet the
security principles required by the customer from a completely hosted, web style interface, to an 'on customer site', complete
stand alone system. Whichever is chosen, the user experience is the same.

The TUT CANBus Interface provides access to an in-vehicle system
reporting facility, enabling the collection of:
• Vehicle telematic information
• Driver behaviour statistics
• Vehicle parameters e.g. blue lights operation
• Journey analysis
Utilising the existing Terrafix in-vehicle computer, and existing communications
system data can be passed to multiple reporting platforms, for example the
Terrafix Management Server or alternatively the TerraTRACK system. Bespoke
reports may be generated by the customer in 'real time' utilising any of the
data collected.
The Terrafix TUT CANBus Interface can be easily installed and is a cost effective
enhancement to your existing Terrafix Mobile Data system, providing the user
with effective and efficient management of resources.
