INVEA-TECH 1 100 G s interception Probe

It i s a c o m m o n practice i n communication n e t w o t s t h a t
active n e t w o t devices can be used to collect data for specific
n e t w o t applications. Typical examples are MSC elements o f
mobile n e t w o t s or BRAS routers in ADSL architecture. Such
approach is not always applicable as the active elements o f
the networh are not built with the aim o f data collection and
they very often lach features o r performance t o cover the
needs of specific n e t w o t applications Ii1Re lawful interception.
Therefore, it is beneficial to use dedicated interception probe
especially in high-speed computer networhs.

OEM IP network traffic interception probe
Support for multiple 1/10/40/100GbE ports
L2, L3, L4 header filters, DPI (email, voice, etc)
Wire speed traffic processing guaranteed
Non-intrusive installation into target network
Easy integration with 3rd party systems

Computer n e t w o t s v a r y i n technologies, s p e e d a n d
architecture, therefore INVEA-TECH company offers a wide
range o f interception probes processing multiple I Gbps to 100
Gbps linds. Standard probes are built on commodity hardware,
while high-speed models are based on hardware accelerators
powered by FPGA technology. Hence they are capable of wirespeed pac1Ret processing without any pac1Ret loss. To support
virtualized environment virtual appliances are available as well.

Mobile operator starts a n e w service - A D S L intemet.
According t o law, this operator has to implement lawful
interception solution in this new IP network The operator
already h a s GSM Lawful Interception system installed.
This system includes mediation a n d monitoring center.
INVEA-TECH probes are used on the 10 Gbps+ bac1Rbone
IP n e t w o t a s t h e probes are easily integratable i n t o
existing infrastructure.

Configuration o f interception is done via standardized ETSI
interface or RESTful API. Interception criteria are:

USE CASE2: VOIP CALL QUALITY CHECK

MAC address

Radius username

IP address

TCP/UDP port

IP range

SIP URI

VLAN

Email address

Intercepted pac1Rets are either saved locally, sent to mediation
device, to SFIP server or directly to law enforcement agency
via ETSI handover interface.

Internet

Customer service center needs t o chec1R the quality o f
VolP calls, which requires recording content o f the calls.
INVEA-TECH p r o b e s a r e d e p l o y e d a t t e n d i ff e r e n t
geographical locations. These probes are configured from
central point and data is stored in an SFTP server, where
the calls are available to quality control team to perform
deep analysis.
