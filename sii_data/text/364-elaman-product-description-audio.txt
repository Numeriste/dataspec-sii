Incorporating the latest technology we are proud to announce the arrival of the GSM spy phone.
These phones have the following features:
Listen-in to the mobile conversations made/received on the Spy Phones
Receive copies of all incoming & outgoing SMS (text) messages
Notification, via SMS, of when a call is made or received with the number of the caller or
number dialed
Listen-in to the surrounding conversations/noises of the ‘Spy Phone’
Notification, via SMS, of when the SIM card has been changed and its new number
Remotely change the ‘AN’ (Access Number) by simply sending an SMS (text) command
No alert to the target as there will be NO logs, lights flashing, noises or vibration when a
‘Spy’ feature is activated

SMS INTERCEPTION
Simply give the target the Spy Phone and every time they send or receive a text message a
copy will be sent to your phone (or a different predefined mobile number). Your copy will
include the actual message, the sender/recipient's number and the time & date.

CALL INTERCEPTION
Every time the target makes/receives a call with the Spy Phone you will be notified via SMS
with the caller’s number or the number the target has dialed and if you ring the Spy Phone from
the access number you will be able to intercept the call and hear both sides of the conversation.

ROOM INTERCEPTION
When the Spy Phone is on, but not in use, you can ring into the Spy Phone from the access
number and listen-in to the surrounding conversations/noises. This is the latest and most
popular method of monitoring mobile phone activity, whether it’s to monitor partners/spouses,
colleagues or even your children.

Audio Surveillance Software Manager

Model 6404

The Model 6404 is a graphic user interface to simplify the operator activity in setting and
monitoring the Model 6402 and Model 6403 remote units.
With this software it is possible:
to manage various units, each of them can be singularly called and set
to listen-in to the audio of a single target unit in real-time and to record at the same time on
the PC hard disk
to manage the Model 6403 track list, operating on the commands play/record/delete
to directly download the Model 6403 tracks on the PC hard disk
The Model 6402 is a small and compact device suitable for covert audio surveillance in both
mobile target and fixed concealment applications, for safe monitoring.
To enhance the network accessibility and increase the reliability of the Model 6402
communication channels, a second SIM card from a different GSM provider can be installed in
the unit. The unit can then be programmed to switch (automatically or manually) between the
two GSM providers depending on which provider has the best coverage.
The Model 6402 can communicate to the listening center via SMS and act according to pre-set
conditions or alarms arising from its sensors (motion sensor, vox, light sensor, digital inputs
connected to the vehicle electrical circuits).
The Model 6403 joins the characteristics of the previously mentioned device with a solid state
recorder and high-density flash memory.
The Model 6403 automatically records when audio is detected and the device is not
communicating with the listening center. This recording can be downloaded later when
conditions allow GSM communications to take place.

The Model 4004 transmitters incorporate the following advanced features: scrambler, AGC and
remote control receiver.
The remote controlled functions of the transmitters are power on/off and scrambler on/off.
Two different types of transmitters have been developed for the Model 4004 system. The
Model 4004 Wired Monitoring transmitter (HWM) is to be used on active phone lines or spare
wires. The Model 4004 Carrier Current transmitter (HCC) is to be used on active mains lines.

RECEIVER SYSTEM
The RX module is a small, flat and compact cabinet, which is only 44 mm high. One RX module
handles 2 transmitters simultaneously.
The RX module has the following features:
Target line interface for both PSTN and spare wires (HWM) and mains wires (HCC)
Dual tuner - each with 4 channels
High impedant input for LF audio. Enables monitoring of PSTN line without transmitter
Audio descrambler
Remote control of transmitters
Noise masking for HWM transmitters
Line output for recording
Output for headphones
It is possible to have both HWM and HCC transmitters operating at the same time, enabling the
operator to monitor, for example, one HWM transmitter and one HCC transmitter
simultaneously.
The RX module is powered from an external low voltage source. The RX module is delivered
with a mains adapter, but can also be powered from a car battery.

Model 4020

1 PRODUCT DESCRIPTION
Audio Surveillance Network (ASN) is a complete solution for law enforcement agencies to
collect, transmit, store and analyze audio coming from distant targets at a centralized location.
ASN consists of both hardware and software elements suitable for building a countrywide audio
surveillance system, or to conduct stand-alone tactical operations. A typical ASN layout consists
of various target locations, remote location sites, a central headquarters and a set of observer
terminals.

Audio Surveillance Network

Model 4020

Audio is captured form a target location by audio transmitters containing tiny microphones, and
transferred to the remote location site over a telephone line. Usually, a remote location site
exists near a location exchange. It contains a large bank of receivers to collect audio from
various target locations. The received audio channels are digitized and stored in a remote
location server. The audio data is sent to the headquarters using a DSL or E1 link. The
headquarters stores digital audio coming from a number of remote locations in a huge database.
Observer terminals access the headquarters database using custom written audio surveillance
software. An ActiveX based audio player offers audio analysis capability and on-line comment
tag submission to the observers. ASN is the only system of its kind that offers real-time audio
surveillance from a number of distant targets from beginning to end.

2.1 AUDIO TRANSMITTERS (XRL-ATX)
Audio is collected from the target location using Audio Transmitters (XTL-ATx). Each transmitter
contains a high gain, sensitive microphone. It is installed on the target line irrespective of the
location and polarity. The installation does not interfere with the normal operation of telephone
equipment. XTL-ATx comes in two versions – XRL-ATP works with standard POTS, while XRLATA is designed for ADSL enabled telephone lines. For major operations, up to four XRL-ATx
units can be deployed per target. A user can remotely activate the desired XRL-ATx leaving the
others in standby mode.
Each XRL-ATx has built-in intelligence to sense the line status and start-stop its operation
independent of the user intervention. Salient features of an XRL-ATx are listed below:
Small size 16 x 9 mm
Low current consumption (active 4mA, standby 4 A
High gain microphone 48 dB
Polarity free installation
Seamless operations on PSTN and ADSL enabled lines

2.6 HEADQUARTER SERVERS (XHQ-SER)
The HQ is the main control center of the ASN. It is connected to remote location sites in a star
network topology. The XHQ-SER comprises two database servers, a storage server, and an
application server. The database servers are similar in specification to XRLS servers. The
storage configuration is tailored according to the requirements. To build redundancy, the
database servers are connected to the storage server in cluster configuration. The application
server is an apache based server, which hosts web-based HQ server software. It allows the
observer terminal to access the huge audio database.

2.7 HEADQUARTER SERVER SOFTWARE (XHQ-SW)
The headquarter server software (XHQ-SW) provides the main control of the ASN. XHQ-SW
software is accessed by the Microsoft Internet Explorer through a Web-based environment. The
complex system information remains hidden behind a user friendly graphical user interface
(GUI). All the software pages are interconnected. A user can navigate across them using a
dynamic menu bar. The menu items vary according to the user access privileges.
