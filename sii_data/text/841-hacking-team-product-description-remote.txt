Abugging device for digital crime investigations and intelligence collection
NowSupporting
Target platforms XP, Vista, 7, MacOS,Windows Mobile, iPhone, Symbian, Blackberry

Offensive security technology
Remote Control System is a stealth investigative tool to be used by law enforcement and
security agencies for digital investigations. It enables data and processes to be passively
monitored and actively controlled on selected target devices (PCs and Smartphones),
regardless of whether or not they are connected to the Internet.

Features
Remote Control System enables the detection, monitoring and logging of a variety of
information on target devices.
Personal Computer edition:

Smarthphone edition:

—Files (documents, images, data, etc.)
—Clipboard contents
—Web browsing (including Internet
Explorer and Firefox)
—Application passwords
—Keystrokes (any UNICODE language)
—Printed documents
—Chat/Instant messaging (including
Skype, MSN, Yahoo Messenger)
—Remote Audio Spy
—Camera Snapshots
—VOIP calls (including Skype, MSN,
Yahoo Messenger)
—Command execution
—File transfers

—Call history
—Address book
—Calendar
—Email messages
—Chat/IM messages
—SMS/MMS interception
—Localization (cell signal info, GPS info)
—Remote Audio Spy
—SIM change notification
—Voice calls interception
—File transfers

Remote Control System is a software
eavesdropping device. It hides itself
inside the device without alerting the
user while:
—Modifying files during the installation
phase
—Creating new files on the computer's
hard disk
—Running new processes
—Establishing new network connections
(if the computer is part of a network)

Remote Control System is more than
an eavesdropping device. It can:
Access any user's information
—Execute any command on the target
computer
—Detect specific events and act
accordingly (If/Then logic)
In addition, it can be installed:
- transparent injection proxy
—0 day exploit library (pdf, html, mail,..)
—bootable media (cdrom, pendrive)
—direct HD infection

41'

Life cycle

Remote Control System can be configured before installation, in order to fulfill specific
requirements of different investigative scenarios. After configuration, Remote Control
System's infection module (the trojan) is installed onto the target device, by means of physical
or logical techniques. Remote Control System can then be controlled from Remote Control
System's control station, which is a dashboard used by investigators. Investigators can
remotely reconfigure any infected devices at any time for maximum flexibility.

Unique solution for maximum customer protection
Each trojan is virtually unique for each customer. Every time they are generated, they are
different, both in terms of the logical-binaries and operating features. Different encryption
keys, configuration files and parameters guarantee that a "collision" between two Remote
Control System products is technically infeasible.

Invisibility
Remote Control System's most valuable feature is stealthness. In fact, it is invisible to most
commercially available protection systems such as anti-virus, anti-spyware, personal fimwalls,
desktop protection systems.

Easy to use interface
Anew Flex based controlling interface has been deployed to simplify day to day investigation activities.
