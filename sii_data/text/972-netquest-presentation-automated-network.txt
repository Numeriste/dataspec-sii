Interception Market Dynamics
• Public and National Security are a priority everywhere.
• Surveillance or Monitoring of network traffic continues to be
complicated by multi-protocol high speed networks.
• TDM Networks (SONET/SDH) remain primary transport …even for IP
– Deeply Channelized interfaces and documentation regarding bandwidth
allocation are spotty
– Recent advances enable Ethernet transport on existing networks.

• Legacy Protocols like ATM, Frame and SS7 will remain in the network
for many years.
• Desire to make interception investments in IP centric solutions are
understandable…yet not practical.

Our Mission…

To empower our customers
with the ability to correlate
converged network traffic into
service, customer or target
oriented flows without
distortion.
“It all depends on how we look at things, and not how they are in themselves.”

What are Leased Line Services
• Typically point-to-point and Point-to-multipoint
circuits.

– Often referred to as International Private Line Circuits
(IPLC)

• Bandwidth Pipes

–

T1/E1 and Fractional services
T3/E3
SONET and SDH
Ethernet

• Support for any protocol
• Considered by many as the most secure
NetQuest
Confidential and Proprietary Information of NetQuest Corporation

The Problem

• Private Line Services remain a service mainstay
• Dynamic multi-protocol transport over SONET/SDH
• Agencies are limited in where they can get access to
circuits.
• Circuit access comes without bandwidth allocation
documentation.
• End to End bandwidth allocation can change
• Customer Premise Equipment can be re-configured
without notification.
• Additional protocol support can be changed at CPE
level

Traditional Solutions
• A collection of equipment is
required to gain access to the
multitude of services being
carried.

TAP’s
ADM’s
Routers
ATM Multiplexers
L1/2 Test Equipment

• Configurations that may need
adjustment if end users
change their provisioning.
• Platforms are underutilized
since they are being used in
Half Duplex applications
A better solution is needed!!!

The Ultimate Cost
• Missed Surveillance is Pricele$$
– Many solutions do not notify agencies of
circuit provisioning changes
– Manual scans (survey) are subject to error
– Un-Filtered data can over-run probes and
storage solutions
– Budgets are Budgets

The Solution
• Consolidate multiple
network elements in a
purpose built platform.
• Automatically discover
Layer 1/2/3 allocation
and protocol content
• Provide unified IP
access to intercept
system
• Scalable ports and
bandwidth

The Auto Discovery Process

NetQuest
Confidential and Proprietary Information of NetQuest Corporation

Unified IP Access
• If everything was IP we could:
– Sit on top of the stack and monitor everything
– Eliminate test and multiplexing gear
– Forget the legacy protocols
– Make investments in where we are going

Portfolio Deployment details
• The products can be deployed
as stand alone devices with
direct connections to probes.
• They may also be used in
conjunction with each other the
solve deeply channelized high
speed circuits.
– Higher speed containers of IP are
directed to probes on 10GigE of I4400/8800 platforms
– Lower speed containers and PDH
are cascaded to I-2400 platforms
for deep channel processing

Summary
• Automatic SDH/SONET L1/L2 discovery and
monitoring
• Eliminate multiple network elements and rack
space they occupy
• Protocol translation (Unified IP Access!!!)
• Preserve Probe processing capacity for high
value functions.
• Ensures target data is continually monitored.
• Dramatically reduce CAPEX and OPEX while
increasing the surveillance effectiveness. .
