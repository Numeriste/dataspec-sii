General Description
The CCJI00 & CC1470 was designed t o block cellular networks for all cellular
standards worldwide.
The CCJ100 & CC1470 use state-of-the-art technology for maximum
The unit is controlled by Microprocessor for PLL programming.
The CC] 100 & CC1470 transmit noise signals which disconnects all cellular
communication between mobile phones / base stations.
The jamming radius depends on the strength of the signal in given area.
All cellular signals near the CCJ100 & CCJ470will be totally BLOCKED and will be
unable t o receive or make calls.
When CCJ100 & CCJ470impacts a mobile phone the display will show4'N0SERVICE".

Main ~roducts
Cell Phone Jammers (CCJ & SMJ Series)
The CCJ Series was designed t o block GSM cellular networks and all cellular standards
worldwide.
The CCJ Series uses state-of-the-art technology for maximum performance.
The unit is controlled by a Microprocessor for PLL programming.
The CCJ device transmits a noise signal that disrupts all cellular communication between
mobile phones and base stations.
The SMJ device, based on digital technology, can be programmed t o jam BCCH channels
Based on DDS technology, the jamming distance is as much as I 0 times farther than with
analog technology.
SMJ Series has been designed especially for prison jamming applications.
The result is that all cellular phones near the jammers will be totally Blocked and the cell
phones will be unable t o receive o r make calls. When CCJ or SMJ device affects the
mobile phone, the display will show "NO SERVICE".
Application: Conference rooms, Cinemas, Prison compounds, Special police units
Convoy protection, etc.

RF Comrr ication Jammers (RCJ Series)
The RCJ series state-of-the-art technology is used for maximum performance.
The unit is controlled by a Microprocessor for PLL programming.
Unique modulation technique based on mixed signal is used for maximum jamming
efficiency.
Each module in the RCJ Series transmits a unique noise signal which creates a "firewall"
between transmitter and receiver.
The jamming signal is generated by DDS o r Multy-VC0 chain. This results in rapid
weeping rate along the bands, creating high RF density for the entire length of the
protected frequency band.
Jamming radius of RCJ Series depends on several conditions including: transmitter
frequency; output power; distance from the receiver; and the nature of obstacles.
The system's modularity allows flexible usage under variable conditions.
The system is provided with broadband omni-directional antennas for 360 degrees
protection.
Application
Cowmy pmter=ticm,V!? prutecdon, Special military

unb, Spedal palks mio, Bomb

d2spcrd quad$ etc.
Power Amplifiers
Phantom Technologies Ltd. manufactures a wide range of power amplifiers for a wide
range of applications.
The Phantom PHPA series of power amplifiers offer frequency ranges from 20 MHz t o 18
GHz, output power from IW t o 2KW, air o r liquid cooling, and high efficiency. Both
amplifier systems and amplifier modules are offered in Narrow Band o r Broadband
frequencies, a range of voltages and a variety of connectors.
Counter Surveillance Equipment
This group of products includes a number of effective devices t o provide detection and
location of all major types of electronic surveillance devices - for example: room
transmitters, phone transmitters, body bugs and video transmitters. This equipment is
meant for professional sweep teams, government security personnel and private
individuals with crucial security needs.
