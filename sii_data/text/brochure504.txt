The HINTON Abis Probe is a passive monitoring probe that can
be connected to any cellular network to give service providers
the location-related signaling information that enables them
to derive cellular location and provide subscribers with
sophisticated, geographically targeted applications.

HINTON

Abis Probe

Provides radio measurement data to derive
cellular location
Location API can filter by location area,
Cell 14 cellular number etc

Supports all current cellular networks
(GSM, UMTS, CDMAone, CDMA2000)
Non-intrusive, passive solution avoids
loading carrier network components

The geograph~callocat~onof cellular subscr~bershas become an Important topic for a wide
range of appl~cat~ons.
From lawful Interception and lntell~genceappl~cat~ons
to commercial
ocat~on-basedservlces (LBS), they all depend on the acqursltlon of the subscriber's current
geograph~callocation to the greatest preclslon poss~bleThe HINTON Abis Probe enables
Ih~rd-partyappl~cat~on
developers to prov~deservlces such as locat~on-targetedadvertlslng,
E911 servlces, alert servlces and nav~gat~on
a~ds- using network lnforrnat~ononly. Thls avo~ds
the need for spec~alhandset capab~l~ty
and allows location-based servlces to be offered to all
subscr~bers,even those wlth the most bas~ccellular handsets.

Easily connects to Abis, A and luB, luCS,
]UPS interfaces

The HINTON Abls Probe achieves thls by monltorlng the Interfaces of a cellular network's rad~o
access network (Abis, luB, A-Interface, luCS and others). As a cellular subscr~bermoves,
the~rcellular handset monltors the base station w ~ t hthe strongest s~gnal,but ~talso keeps
jn eye on other nearby base stat~onsthat mlght offer better reception and communicates

funct~onal~ty
allows the HINTON locator

Does not require special handset capability
e.g. GPS, or software

ocation accuracy depends on many factors, including the density of base stations and
nterference from tall buildings, but typical results in an urban area derive location data

No dependency on network infrastructure
Supports in excess of 100,000 concurrent

The HINTON Abis Probe passively monitors signaling l~nks(GSM: Abis,
A UMTS: luB, IuCS, luPS CDMA: Abls, A) and extracts radlo measurements
of cellular handsets In the network. Aggregatlon may be done locally

Location information
The handset-based data that the HINTON Abls Pr
appl~catrons~ncludes:

Cell ID
GSM timing advance or UMTS round-trip delay from serving cell

Received signal strength from serving and adjacent cells
Location area information

Monitoring data using a separate overlay system avoids network

interference and allows enhancement and upgrade independent
of the main network.
