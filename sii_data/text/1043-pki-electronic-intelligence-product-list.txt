Interception and Monitoring Systems
PKI 1500

Cellular Monitoring System
PKI is worldwide one of the leading producers of
monitoring devices of cellular phones.
This highly sensitive field of interception is of
utmost importance to all government agencies,
especially secret-service departments, as
state-relevant information is globally frequently
exchanged via cellular telephones. To control
such tasks it is indispensable to use the PKI
devices.
PKI 1500 is a multi-channel cellular monitoring
system designed for passive interception of GSM
radio signals. It intercepts GSM network
information data directly without interfering with
the GSM network. It is completely passive and it
will never be detected by the target person. The
system includes eight duplex channels, control
and data processing analysis software, UHF
antennas and laptop. It has the advantage of
compact design, friendly interface and is easy to
operate. It can easily be put into a vehicle or
anywhere you want for your action. The system
provides voice monitoring and very accurate
tracking and locating function of target mobile
phone.
PKI 1500 is the most advanced and unique GSM
locating subsystem, without using any 3rd party
GPS device and with the only built-in fabulous
full angle antenna. The GSM locating sub-system
is built-in and can be separated from the whole
system. The system is equipped with a
decryption module which is capable of handling
A 5.0 and decrypting A 5.2 encryption protocols
in real-time.
Basis functions
The system provides eight duplex channels using
the following frequency ranges of 900 MHz, 1900
MHz or 900/1800 MHz. According to some
feature of the signal, the system can
automatically select the best channel to monitor
and record. The system supports simultaneously
operation on multiple networks and is suitable
during mobile operation. While operating in an
area where many cellular phones exist PKI 1500
offers two working modes: in random
interception mode it can monitor and record up
to 8 full duplex calls and SMS including the
relevant duplex phone identities such as TMSI,
IMI, IMEI, BCD number, target distance from the
base station etc.. In special mode the system can
monitor and record incoming and outgoing calls
and SMS of special target phones and at the
same time the system can extract all relevant
phone identities of target phones.
Localisation
PKI 1500 works in real time and with a locating
accuracy of approx. 2 meters. It uses vehicle and
personal locating subsystems in order to locate
the target phone. The position of the inactive
target phone will be rapidly (10-15 minutes)
located without becoming aware by the phone
user. Should the operator know the location area
and cell IDs of the target phone in advance the
locating time will be even much shorter.

10

Monitoring
PKI 1500 provides three modes, i.e. target phone
monitoring, blind interception and short
message monitoring in the unencrypted GSM
network. When target phone monitoring is
required the system monitors all details
concerning the target phone call, i.e. it provides
the phone number of both parties, voice, cell
parameters, when calling started and ended,
distance from the base station etc. In case of
blind interception the system collects call
information in a local region. By using its
8-duplex-channels
PKI
1500
records
conversations, calling and called numbers
simultaneously. The provided information can be
listened to in real time or as playback later. The
third mode is the short message monitoring
mode which allows not only blind interception of
short messages in local regions but also
direction finding and locating of the target phone
sending short messages.
Soft Ware
PKI delivers a special developed software with C
language. We provide a pre-installed laptop and
media installation for backup. All intercepted
communications (voice, SMS and the relevant
identity datas) are stored on a hard disk which
can be easily accessed by the operator. The
software has a strong ability to query target
records and to relisten.
Installation
The host equipment will be placed in the vehicle
whereas the antenna can be camouflaged in any
roof box.

PKI 1800

Digital Telephone Monitoring System
The PKI 1800 is a comprehensive and state-ofthe-art end-to-end solution for monitoring,
processing, analysis and dissemination of
intercepted telecommunication interactions.
Due to rapid structural changes in worldwide
telecommunication systems a solution
integrating all such tasks is provided by the PKI
1800. It offers facilities to monitor ISDN, Digital,
PCM30 transmissions as well as all other forms
of communication whether they be voice, fax,
modem, radio communication or other data
transfer. Based on a single, unified platform, PKI
1800 handles all kinds of telephone and Internet
data and thus offering unprecedented features. It
provides security agencies with flexibility,
reliability and versatility in signal intelligence
interception and analysis. The PKI 1800
combines all these facilities to comfortably
managing unlimited amounts of intercepted
communications together with instant target
information by just using a minimal amount of
space and manpower. The major feature of the
PKI 1800 is its flexibility and extraordinary
storage capacity, linked to its ability to instantly
recall, via the displayed data management target
software, intercepted target telephone calls
without interrupting the digital tape recording
and archiving process. This enables the operator
to either carry out interception and playback from
one system, or optionally via a separate playback
unit. This means that highly classified and
priority interception can be configured for
transfer by authorised users on a real time basis
to a selected location ensuring that the right
persons are informed on time.
The PKI 1800 is available in several versions,
depending on the number of channels and
end-users monitoring requirements, from
minimum 8 channels to 64 or max 128 channels.
The major criteria of the PKI 1800 software is to
display all information immediately and to enable
instant evaluation, thus dramatically reducing the
time needed, compared to time-consuming
evaluation of reel or audio tapes. The software is
known as the target evaluation and configuration
interface (TEC) which is installed onto the
delivered workstation. The sophisticated menu
provides optimal guidance for selection/viewing
and processing of large quantities of data. The
TEC software has one control menu and 4
submenus being linked to user's authorisation
key code. They are easiliy accessible and can be
seen at a glance on the display monitor. Upon
entry to the main control menu selection, the
user will see - displayed on the screen - the
current channel status which provides activity
information as well as remaining tape time, disk
end time and selection for the 4 submenus via
the preprogrammed password. The configuration
menu enables the user to select and change the
technical charateristics of each channel
depending on the input conditions. This enables
the PKI 1800 to monitor telephone interception
from various types of exchanges and radio
communication input channels simultaneously.

• Non detectable input impedance
• Simultaneous playback and
on-line recording
• Network upgradeable, high MTBF
reliability, 1/T1 interception

• Automatic monitoring, interception
and recording
• Password protection
• Selectable input characteristics,

essential accessory to the PKI 1800. Housed in a
standard desk top PC with built-in 4 channel
voice card, hard disk and loudspeaker the digital
playback unit is used for a number of
applications. Usually used as a playback unit for
evaluation of recorded data it alternatively can be
used as a mass storage facility for archiving or as
a supervising position. It incorporates the
standard PKI 1800 software enabling instant
recall and evaluation. The intercepted data is
loaded onto the digital playback unit from the
DAT cassette or linked to the PKI 1800 for
automatic download. The unit can be installed
with one or two DAT drives, enabling the
evaluated data to be downloaded onto the 2nd

PKI 2265

Room Transmitter (PCB)
Wherever monitoring transmitters have to be
used in disguised operations, this micro
transmitter is the perfect choice, as it has been
especially designed for camouflaged operations.
Therefore, and to reduce the size to its minimum,
just the printed circuit board (PCB) is supplied.
For each and every government department’s
operation, this tiny little transmitter should be
used for discrete observation of rooms. Because
of its small size and unobtrusive pattern, it is a
perfect tool to monitor rooms from inside a
hidden place. A film-size plastic cover protects
the components against environmental
influences. Powered by battery and equipped
with a highly sensitive microphone, this
transmitter can be placed into any object of daily
use and picks up the sound from up to ten
meters. The crystal controlled transmittance

guarantees a totally stable frequency which only
can be received by our special receivers like PKI
2220. Depending on surrounding conditions, a
transmitting range of 800 to 1000 meters may be
achieved.
Specifications:
• Easy to disguise
• Looks like installed standard parts

its small size and unobtrusive appearance, this
transmitter really is the champion in its class.
The transmitter is supplied as a printed circuit
board (PCB) only and is coated with a special
protective lacquer which protects it against
environmental conditions. This allows a fast and
easy installation into every kind of analogue
telephone set in which it looks like a standard
component being completelyinconspicuous to
the user. The installation inside the telephone set
should be made in serial mode; both polarities
are allowed. PKI 2270 is only transmitting when
a telephone conversation starts and therefore is
non-detectable when the telephone is not in use.

Interception and Monitoring Systems
PKI 2275

Mains Transmitter (PCB)
Monitoring of rooms essentially needs to have
camouflaged transmitters, but in most cases no
new items can be placed into the room in
question. Therefore already existing devices have
to be used and equipped with an unobtrusive
transmitter. For this purpose, the PKI 2275 is the
right solution. Due to the very small size of this
printed circuit board (PCB) mains powered
transmitter, it does not need much space and
very easily can be concealed in sockets, lamps,
junction-boxes etc. Additionally the protective
cover with a special lacquer shields from
occasionally unwanted contacts and short-cuts.
Depending on existing power supply, the PKI
2275 can be supplied either in 110 to 115 VAC/60
Hz or 220 to 240 VAC/50 Hz versions. The
integrated microphone of highest sensitivity
allows to capture sounds from a distance of up to
10 meters. With its output power of 4 mW a

transmitting range of up to 800-1000 meters
may be achieved (depending on surrounding
conditions).

PKI 2290

Voice Activated Transmitter
In many cases the monitoring of a suspicious
room has to be effected over a long time period,
but the room only can be entered once and the
monitoring device has to be installed quickly and
easily. Furthermore this monitoring device can
only be operated by batteries and should be
activated only when persons are in the room.
Therefore and in order to save battery capacity,
the PKI 2290 has been developed according to
the latest technology standards as it is
automatically activated by reception of
noises/sounds. Whenever there is no sound, the
built in automatic voice control (Acoustomatic)

GPS Personal Tracking System
The PKI 2670 is an easy to use, but very efficient
GPS tracking system offering the possibility to
determine the exact location of a person. Its use
is password-protected and it allows comfortable
and easy control of a specific person. After
switching-on, the PKI 2670 works fully
automatic and does not need any further data
input or control. The operation status is indicated
by 4 LED’s. The position data is given every 60
seconds, either by pressing the “INFO” button or
by activation of the integrated movement
detector. This informs the operator of the
location of the person, incl. name of town and
street name. This information can also be shown
on digital maps. The full data of the last 120 days
can also be recalled. Furthermore, the supplied
communicator allows direct calls from the
system operator to the user and, by using the

“INFO”-button”, the user can call for attention.
The status of the “INFO-button can be
transmitted to five different e-mail addresses. If
PKI 2670 is not moved it automatically switches
back into stand-by mode and on detection of

Interception and Monitoring Systems
PKI 2715

Computer Interception System
„Tempest“ is the common term for every kind of
radiation emitted by computers. Each device and
part - such as printed circuit boards, monitors
and connecting cables - emit a specific radio
signal (compromising radiation) which may
contain the fullscreen content of the actual
operation of the computer in question. Such
signals can be received and reconstructed with
our PKI 2715. This provides a fast and easy
monitoring of a PC in order to see what work
actually is done on this. By means of a
directional antenna and the special receiver, the
incoming data are synchronised and analysed.
The received signal then can be seen on the
provided display. Depending on type of computer
to be monitored the max. distance may vary from
approx. 10 to 50 meters. The complete system is
supplied by us to government departments

exclusively in order to guarantee full prevention
from unauthorised persons committed with
industrial espionage, terrorism or any other
criminal act.

PKI 2775

Scrambled GSM Phone
Most people think that mobile phone calls cannot
be eavesdropped or tapped because the system
already uses encryption. Unfortunately this is not
the case! Actually in most countries the signals
are encrypted between the mobile phone and the
base station but this data stream can be
decrypted with a normal PC. It is even easier to
tap GSM phones with a device that simulates a
base station which inserts itself between the
mobile phone and the provider network. In
Germany such easy-doing eavesdropping causes
damages of approx. 10 billion Euro per year just
in the field of industrial espionage. PKI 2775
offers the right choice in order to be prevented
from this! Each PKI 2775 works with an
individually generated and certified key pair.
These are stored on the net card which is
inserted into the phone. If another PKI 2775
(which has its own individual key pair) is called,
using the crypto function, the partners are
authenticated by means of the two key pairs and
the two chip cards. A “one-off” session key (one
out of 1038 possible keys) is generated and this
is used only for this single communication. This
session key encrypts all signals transmitted
between the two phones. Whoever intercepts this
encrypted data stream will only hear a noise
which cannot be decrypted even with the highest
performance mainframe computers. PKI 2775
operates efficiently in all standard 900/1800 MHz
GSM networks in all countries.
In addition to the integrated encryption system
PKI 2775 has all the features of a normal, Up-todate business mobile phone. It still can be used
for unencrypted calls to any other phone. For all
encrypted and secure communications as well as
for all unprotected calls your standard SIM card
is used - therefore you do not have to change
your phone number in order to use all PKI 2775
features.

Specifications:
• Dual Band GSM 900/1800 MHz
• Full graphic display (106x56 Pixel)
• Rechargeable battery 940 mAh (Li-Ion E)

PKI 2950

Microphone Cable Reel
The PKI 2950 especially was developed for wired
room monitoring applications. Due To its
cable-based operation this unit is not detectable
by any counter measure equipment. The
subminiature electret microphone with its small
dimensions and the small diameter of the
shielded cable is ideally suitable to be hidden
behind wallpapers, curtains or in window frames.
The small dimensions of the microphone prevent
from detection by measuring equipment based
on analysing the non-linear junction effect
generated in semiconductors. The complete
system consists of the highly sensitive electret
microphone with shielded connection cable, a
cable reel with output socket, headphones and
the separate audio amplifier. The supplied audio
amplifier provides a low-noise amplification
adjusted to the subminiature electret microphone
of this system together with a 5 band graphic
equaliser and every necessary output for direct
listening or recording of conversations. Features
like direct listening with headphones, a socket for
recording devices and the possibility to extend
the total cable length by driving different reels in
cascade, fulfill all requirements for effective
surveillance.

Interception and Monitoring Systems
PKI 2960

Optical Microphone
The PKI 2960 ultra-sensitive optical microphone
captures a wide range of sounds from normal
conversation to soft whispering or even the
shuffling of papers with excellent sound
accuracy. Being designed for governmental use
in SWAT, Special Task Forces and tactical
operations it offers surveillance operations and
applications requiring RFI/EMI immunity. A beam
of light is sent through an optical fiber to a sound
sensitive membrane. Sound signals cause the
membrane to vibrate and modulate the intensity
of the light reflected by the membrane, which is
then translated into an electrical signal. PKI 2960
delivers a high signal to noise ratio, so even very
low-level sound inputs can be heard clearly and
accurately from many meters away. With an
omni-directional polar pattern, the PKI 2960 can
capture sounds from all directions, thus
maximising voice representation. The excellent
frequency response provides true-tosound
reproduction. The PKI 2960 cannot be detected
by electromagnetic methods since the
microphone head neither contains metal parts
nor generates electromagnetic fields and is
separated from its electronic components by
several meters of optical fiber. With its miniature
dimensions and versatile configurations it can be
installed in a variety of ways to elude discovery
both by the naked eye and sophisticated
detection equipment such as non-linear junction
detectors. Because of its RFI and EMI immunity

the PKI 2960 can continue to operate even in the
harshest environments without any effect to its
performance.

PKI 2985

Wireless Stethoscope mono, Wireless Stethoscope stereo

These stethoscopes find their application where
the human ear reaches its limits. The acoustic
receptor is very quickly fixed by provided mastic
material. It can be attached to the wall (up to 50
cm thick), window, door frame etc. The
miniature receiver captures the signal from a
distance of up to 100 m. Longer distances are
also possible if required, however, this will
reduce receiving time from 30 to 15 hours. The
stereo version PKI 2985 is best suitable for
operations with loud background noise such as
street noise or similar. These sounds can be
eliminated by our devices PKI 2260 or PKI 2500.
The Piezo acoustic receivers are high sensitive

and capture acoustic oscillation on hard
materials, as e.g. on pipes, windows, etc. so that
even spoken word are clearly audible. On request
we are able to deliver a compatible recorder with
70 hours recording time (PKI 2980R refers).

Interception and Monitoring Systems
PKI 3000

Outdoor Investigation Shooting Stethoscope-Kit
For more than 40 years PKI is engaged in AV
observation out- and indoor. Consequently our
product range offers numerous devices for this
application. Please see our below listed devices:
PKI 2215 - PKI 5715.
Often the rooms which shall be monitored have
only access from outside, so that due to security
reasons this is the only possible surveillance
method. PKI 3000 therefore offers a very special
version as now upper floors can be monitored.
On activation the transmitter is shot by a
launcher, that is equipped with a CO2-cartridge,
up to a distance of 25 m at full speed. If the
transmitter reaches a window or masonry it will
stick there and wirelessly transmit the acoustic
waves captured from behind the wall up to 50 m.
Reception is possible by adequate wide band
receivers.

PKI 3100

Laser Monitoring System
This PKI 3100 Laser Monitoring System has
been designed for secret surveillance operation if
access to the target room is totally impossible.
The laser transmitter sends an invisible infra-red
beam to the window of the room to be
monitored. A certain part of the laser beam is
reflected by the windowpane which vibrates
slightly due to sound waves caused by the
spoken words inside. Due to the law of optics,
the beam is reflected in the same angle, i.e. the
angle of incidence is equal to the angle of
reflection. In order to capture the reflected beam
in the middle of the lens the receiver must be
positioned very accurately. The captured beam
can now be converted into electrical signals,
which - after filtering - are amplified and fed into
headphones and/or recording devices.
