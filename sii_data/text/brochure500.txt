High Performance GPS Surveillance and Tracking
Ocellus S100 is a High Sensitivity GPS/
GPRS remote surveillance and tracking
device, which allows users to monitor the
location of vehicles and assets of all kinds.
High Sensitivity GPS enables operation in
urban canyons, under heavy foliage and
even indoors, and permits installation in
locations where a direct sky view is not
available. It is particularly suitable for
operation in and under vehicles.
Its internal activity sensor enables power
saving by allowing the unit to power down
in between position fixes, contributing t o
its exceptional battery life.
Attachment to any tracking subject is
simple because of its small size (133 X 48
X 25 mm) and removable multifunction
magnetic mount.
The integrated antennas and battery
make the unit highly reliable by
removing the need for a complex wiring
installation. With its High Sensitivity GPS,

sophisticated power management and
integrated tri-band GSM/GPRS module,
the Ocellus S100 enables users to both
enhance existing telematics applications
and enable new business concepts t o
be realised.
