Fully weatherproof. relatively small and backpack mounted. the backpack Jammer has a robust
mechanical design. addressing different frequency range requirements simultaneously.
When driving in an anti IED vehicle, equipped with counter 1E0 jamming system. convoy troops have
the advantage of continuous protection. However, when troops continue to ground missions, forces are
exposed to hidden and concealed remote controlled improvised explosive devices (RCIED).
The backpack Jammer provides the solution for this gap. This back pack, man portable jammer is blanketing
agiven area to prevent radio receivers from achieving RE signal for detonation of remote controlled explosive
weapons. providing IED protection for ground forces.The backpack Jammer dismounted IED and radio jammer
is equipped with long mission-life rechargeable batteries, allowing field use Based on advanced research and
development in counter IED technology, the backpack portable jammer can be configured to block different
frequency bands including: VHF, UHF, cellphones. satellite phones and more. This 1EDjamming device can be

Abattle proven, modular wireless communication jammer, designed for vehicle or fixed installation,
Consisting multiple transmission frequency bands and high transmission power, the ECM IED
Jammer is used for force protection in complex scenarios where various threats might be used and
large coverage area is required.Remote Controlled Improvised Explosive Devices, also known as
RCIEDs or IEDs, are a major threat in most conflict zones around the world, causing heavy casualties
among ground troops. With time, IED threat is expanding to other territories worldwide, used by
terror organizations to execute attacks in popular and crowded locations.As this threat continues
to develop technologically, military and security forces have to maintain advanced operational
capabilities, by using an IED defeat solution that is based on adaptive technology, taking under
account current and future threatsDesigned to defend military convoys and E0D/ bomb disposal
teams against Remote Controlled Improvised Explosive Devices, The ECM IED Jamming device
effectively blocks the signals of radio transmitters used to remotely activate explosive devices and
bombs. By accurately jamming the remote control frequencies, it cuts off radio communications from
the triggering transmitter to the receiver on the bomb, thus immediately preventing bomb detonation
and securing nearby civilians, bomb squads team members or military convoy.The ECM IED Jammer
consists of a multi-channel jamming transmitter and unique software, configured as a modular jamming
system that allows the end-user to select protection against any threat.Delivering powerful jamming
signals through a matching array of antennas, the ECM Bomb Jammer installed in a vehicle creates
asecure electronic shield around the anti-IED vehicle, providing IED protection to the entire team.

VOSIANALYS
Vo i c e L i e D e t e c t o r
12201
Aninnovative, highly advanced, sophisticated software system that is specifically designed to provide the
professional user easy access to truth verificationandemotion identificationbyusing vocal parameters
Thesystem is designed for security officials: governmentsand security organizations, law enforcement agencies
andimmigration authorities, police, military and private investigators. For these users, faster verification
meansmore efficiencywhichtranslates into cost effectiveness of the decisionmaking process.
Thesystem is a combination of three different tools:
OnlineMode - for quick and immediate analysis during an open-ended interview, this occurs in real time
OfflineMode - for an in-depth analysis of pre-recorded material
InvestigationMode - for a pre-defined closed-ended question analysis relating to a specific issue. It is similar to the
questionsused for traditional polygraphexaminations and uses the same techniques, e.g., COT. POT, etc.
Thesystem offers a new analysis technique for all these modes of operations. The "RichPsychologicalAnalysis"
(R.P,A) is automatically generated in all of the modes. In addition, for cases in whichyou require additional tools to
analyze results. LVAprovides two sets of graph displays for easy andconvenient manual analysis. LVAwas designed
tobe as friendly as possible while still offeringmaximum reliability and a familiar WINDOWSTM environment.
Thesystem uses "psychologicalpatterns" detection as well as three different and independent equations. These equations
distinguishbetween stress resulting from excitement and any other emotional stress. Distinctions are also made between
confusionand other cognitive or global stress resulting from the circumstancessurrounding the issue being discussed. It
alsodistinguishes between "acceptable levels" of stress and between stresses emanating from attempts at deception.
Thesystem detects levels of tension. rejection, fear, embarrassment and attempts to outsmart or answer cynically. It also
measuresthe subject's level of thinking. LVA also measures the willingness of the subject to answer in the relatively new Stop
orSay (SOS) parameter. Using Deception Patterns. LVAcan achieve the greatest accuracy rate in detecting deceptions.
