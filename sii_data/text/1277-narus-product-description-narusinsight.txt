Narus Offerings

Built on the NarusInsight Traffic Intelligence system, the NarusInsight Solution for
Intercept passively monitors multiple links on the network. It monitors each packet
on the network link and analyzes it against a target list input by the providers or
directly by a law enforcement agent. If the packet matches the target criteria, it is
captured for formatting and delivery to storage, law enforcement or directly to
optional content rendering and analysis tools.

Capture and Delivery
• Passive model collects off the line at wire speeds
• Architecture supporting data capture from asymmetric networks
• Flexible structure to support standards-based and other optimized forms of intercept

v elo p m e nt
K it

Each solution is designed to be modular so information can be collected once and used by multiple northbound applications
either in conjunction with one another or for a specific purpose.

Rendering and Analysis
• Playback of multiple application types as they happen or from past events
• Support for built-in or third-party options
• Secure and scalable administration functions

NarusInsight™ Solution for Intercept Operational Flow

Cyber criminals are real. Countries worldwide are under attack.
Government organizations and administrations mandate Intercept.
As service providers and government organizations migrate to next-generation networks and continue
to offer new communications services, the complexity associated with monitoring those networks for
intercept purposes increases dramatically. Whether the intercept requirement is for compliance with
lawful intercept mandates (via published standards or through other means) or purely for managing
private government or national networks, the solution must be scalable and flexible enough to
deal with multiple environments and traffic patterns.
While intercepting communications on circuit-switched voice networks follows a well-known and
established process, intercepting IP traffic can be far more complex, requiring the ability to see and
extract only targeted data from large, heterogeneous networks over which millions of communications
sessions are constantly and simultaneously moving. Operators must be selective in their warrant-based
targeting while still having the ability to ensure complete data capture for defined users and services.
This requires a solution with multiple forms of targeting criteria, while not losing focus on the real
need to ensure the privacy of non-targeted users sharing the same communications paths as the
targeted users.

Key Differentiators

1. Specify and manage targeting criteria
4. Reconstruct, render and/or analyze
captured content
• Repackage raw packets into consumable content
• View Web pages, read text and e-mail/Webmail
messages, listen to VoIP calls
• Examine raw packet output for network
forensic analysis

•
•
•
•

Associate targets to case IDs
Define locations to capture data/traffic
Define destination for captured packets
Report on active targets/cases

Advanced targeting, capture and rendering system
• Precision targeting using behavioral and signature analysis
• Real-time targeting and capture of multiple IP-based protocols and applications (layer-2 to layer-7)
• Non-intrusive monitoring transparent to network
• Support for multiple rendering and analysis tools
Vendor-service and network-agnostic
• Support for wireline and wireless networks at broadband speeds
• Internet, Webmail, VoIP and e-mail all in one platform
• Support for fully asymmetric traffic across large heterogeneous networks
• Targeting and capture in MPLS VPN environments
Market-leading scalability to enable monitoring networks of any size
• Carrier-grade speed and performance with support for links up to 10GigE/OC-192/STM-64
• Distributed collection across very large, geographically and technologically distributed networks
• Centralized analysis and presentation of networkwide information in real time
Easily extensible and highly modular
• Modular structure enables users to add new application components as needed via plug-in framework
• Flexible output format ensures support for national standards or non-standard output to law
enforcement or forensic analysis applications

2. Monitor the network and capture target traffic

3. Format and deliver full packets
• Convert traffic into required format
o PCAP, XML, IPDR, ASCII, standards
by region
• Deliver intercepted communications
directly to LEA or to file for rendering
and forensic analysis

• Communicate target IDs to collection components
• Passively analyze all traffic in designated locations
• Capture only traffic associated with targeting
criteria
