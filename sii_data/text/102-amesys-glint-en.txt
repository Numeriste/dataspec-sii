GLINT – STRATEGIC NATIONWIDE INTERCEPTION BASED
ON EAGLE CORE TECHNOLOGY

RECORD, DECODE, STORE AND
DISPLAY T HE INTERCEPTED
NETWORK TRAFFIC
GLINT is a system designed to
monitor and intercept in real time
information on very high data rate
network . This system is capable of
monitoring a wide range of protocols,
including mail, voice over IP (VoIP),
webmail, chat sessions …
GLINT is an entirely scalable system
that can fit different size of network
flow up to several 10 gigabit/s full
duplex.

GENERAL USE
GLINT is a global strategic system in which y ou are able to aggregate many different sources of traffic: High data
rate IP networks, Microwav e Links, PSTN, GSM networks or ev en Satelitte networks. Amesys is able to prov ide
the different probes to capture network traffic on all these different ty pes of support. Our system can also accept
any other standard E1 or Ethernet incoming link if needed.
For analysis of IP networks, our core technology - EAGLE – is able to recognize more than 300 different network
protocols including mail protocols (SMTP, POP3, IMAP …), Voice ov er IP conversations (SIP, H323, RTP, RTCP
…), webmail transactions (hotmail, y ahoo, gmail ...), or chat conv ersations (MSN, AIM, Y ahoo! …). All of them
are classified thanks to adv anced techniques based on protocol syntax analysis (Deep Packet Inspection),
whereas competitive products do it through network port identification that can easily be misled.
At any time, the investigators can request the entire database in real time with an unlimited number of key word,
with an email address (sender or receiver), with phone numbers, with the type or name of attached files or with
the caller or callee name in audio conv ersations.

ADDITIONAL SMART M ODULES
To be able to analy ze efficiently the huge tsunami of incoming information, Amesys can provide a wide range of
smart adv anced modules to help the operators in the process of Intelligence. We can add in our GLINT systems
smart modules like Voice to Text Transcription, automatic translation, geo-localization of calls, semantic analysis,
topic spotting, speaker recognition …

EFFICIENT HUMAN ORGANIS ATION IN M ONITORING CENTER
Thanks to many years of experience working f or Intelligence agencies, Amesys can help y ou to build a real
monitoring center based on the intelligence philosophy. Our expert engineers will be there to help y ou f rom the
deployment to the training of y our inv estigators including also operational and technical training.
