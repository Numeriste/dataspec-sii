Intelligent Optical signal Management
Glimmerglass Intelligent Optical Systems revolutionize optical signal management
by enabling network operators 10 rapidly and remotely access, distribute and monitor
optical signals and create and reconfigure optical paths in real time. Advanced
management software combined with purely optical. photonic cross-connects provide
remote operators with superior visibility and control of optical signals.
Intelligent Optical systems provide transparent signal access and are key enablers
of the Glimmerglass СуЬег5wеер" T h e i r unique capabilities enable the dynamic
selection and distribution of optical signals for analysis and storage.
Glimmerglass optical systems enable operators to:
• Access and monitor optical signals in real time without disrupting traffic
• Remotely create and reconfigure optical signal paths in milliseconds
• Handle any data rate, any protocol and any format including OWUM
• Select, duplicate, and distribute optical signals to one or marry locations
• Continuously monitor signals and remotely test and diagnose optical paths

Create
Glimmerglass systems provide a fully non-blocking, transparent cross-connect. In
milliseconds an optical path can be created between any fiber input and output. Since
the technology is fully transparent, the newly created optical path will transport any
signal regardless of data format or speed.

Monitor
Continuous optical power monitoring combined with transparent switching forms a
superior solution for remotely monitoring network paths and performing diagnostics.
Loophack paths may he created in milliseconds to help isolate a fault to a particular
piece of equipment

Reconfigure
Glimmerglass systems are the ideal solution for remotely adding, reconfiguring, and
disconnecting optical paths on demand and making system level topology changes.
