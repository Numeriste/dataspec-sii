Cyber
i2 CONNECTS THE CYBER WORLD WITH THE REAL WORLD
Accel er ati ng You r M ission .

Cyber, part of the Intelligence-Led Operations Platform, brings together thousands of real-world data sources and
millions of data points to link amorphous cyber threats with actual people and physical locations.

"We have built our future upon a capability that we have not learned how to protect."
- George Tenet, Former CIA Director
Attacks on information infrastructure pose the most
serious economic and national security threat of the
21 st century. Gone are the days of individual hac kers;
today's cyber criminals are members of organ ised
crime rings and hostile nation states.
Many "cyber solutions" provide info r mation about
activity on your network. What IP address talked to
what other IP addresses, what data may have passed
through the Internet cloud . However, none of them
can connect your analysis with the real-world the
way i2 can . Only i2 brings together thousands of
real-world data sources and millions of data points
that link amorphous cyber threats w ith actual people
and physical locations.

Cyber is used worldwide by:

Robust analytics and activity timeline mapping help
identify patterns to predict and prevent future
attacks
Extensi ble tools that read and digest data from
various sources help you hone in on the subject of
your investigation by connecting people and places
to cyber events
• ldentify, penetrate , and neutralise foreign operations
that use cyber means as the primary tradecraft
methodology
• Know what's happening on your network from the
inside out

Turn large quantities of data into
actionable intelligence
Key Capabilities and Benefits

• Find information from unique sources and
relationships such as user groups, subnets, machine
and human social networks, spear phishing
operations, child exploitation networks, IP net
intrusions and embedded PDFs

The Cyber solution analysis platform provides:
• Rich extraction, analysis and visualisation
capabilities that turn high quantities of
cyber data into actionable intelligence

• Connect unlimited unique data sources to validate
your investigation, including automated number
plate recognition data

• Rapid pattern analysis quickly identifies key
characteristics to predict and prevent
future attacks

• Generate solid documentation for investigation
and prosecution purposes

• Sophisticated analytical database for
managing and analysing multi-source data

Easy to manage, deploy and maintain
• Cyber is a flexible solution that allows you to
layer an array of currently available data sets as well
as accommodate future technologies and data
sets as they become available
• Train your analysts on only one programme while
still gathering intelligence from all of your sources

• Geo lookup
• Look up geographical information of IP
addresses

• Blacklist Checker
• Check IP addresses against real-time
blacklists

• lncrease network awareness and improve best
practices
