Finfisher Introduction
Introduction to Finfisher
Elaman is proud to present its new FinFisher product suite to aid government
agencies in gathering critical IT information from target computers. This suite
contains an array of IT solutions to help intelligence agencies gain access to
information that cannot be procured using traditional methods.

Operational Features
Information gathering
Sniffing
Exploitation
Monitoring

FinFisher USB Suite
The FinFisher USB Suite is a set of two USB Dongles, two bootable CDs and
the FinFisher HQ – a Graphical User Interface (GUI) – for analysis of retrieved
data. The FinFisher USB Suite has been engineered for use by any agent,
informant, or basically anyone who is able to gain access to a target
computer, with minimal computer knowledge. All that needs to be done is to
insert the USB into the target computer for a short period of time. It can
extract information like usernames and passwords, e-mails, files and other
critical system and network information from Windows systems.
FinFisher Remote Hacking Kit
When physical access to a target computer cannot be achieved, the FinFisher
Remote Hacking Kit provides agents with all the necessary tools used by
professional hackers to remotely gain access to target computers. It consists
of a notebook running our specially engineered FinTrack operating system,
various wireless equipment, a 500 GB USB hard-disk containing default
password lists and rainbow tables, and much more. The FinFisher Remote
Hacking Kit can be used for internal security assessment as well as IT
intelligence gathering operations targeting public servers or personal
computers.

FinSpy
FinSpy is a cutting-edge, professional Trojan horse for Windows systems,
which enables you to remotely access and monitor target computers. The
basic functionality includes features like Skype Monitoring, Chat Logging,
Keystroke Recording, accessing printed and deleted files, and many more
features. The Trojan horse is completely hidden and all its communications
are entirely covert.
FinFly
FinFly is a transparent HTTP proxy that can modify files while they are being
downloaded. Elaman has created two versions of this software; the FinFlyLite and the FinFly-ISP. The FinFly-Lite can be used by the agency within a
local network to append FinSpy or a custom Trojan horse to executables that
are downloaded by a target computer. The FinFly-ISP can be integrated into
an Internet Provider’s network to infect en masse or targeted computers.
FinAudit
Network and system security are top priorities in today’s changing world. For
this reason, Elaman provides FinAudit – a security assessment of the
customer’s network and computers carried out by a high specialized Tiger
Team to ensure the customer is protected as much as possible from local and
remote attacks.
FinTraining
Elaman offers highly specialized FinTraining courses to educate agents in
various offensive and defensive security topics. Apart from the Basic Hacking
courses, several advanced courses can be given, including topics such as
Hacking Voice-over-IP, Hacking Wireless Systems, Basic Cryptography and
many more. The level of training is highly dependent on customer knowledge
and special training courses can be customized to meet specific customer
needs.
DEVELOPMENTS IN 2008
FinFly-ISP
FinFly is a transparent HTTP proxy that can modify files while they are being
downloaded. The FinFly-ISP can be integrated into an Internet Provider’s
network to infect en masse or targeted computers.
FinCrack
Elaman has developed FinCrack – a high-speed super cluster for cracking
passwords and hashes. It currently supports password recovery for Microsoft
Office documents, NTLM /LM (Windows user hashes), WPA wireless
networks, UNIX DES (Unix password hashes), WinZip protected files, and
PDF password-protected files.
FinWifiKeySpy
FinWiFiKeySpy is a device for remotely sniffing keystrokes of commercial
wireless keyboards (e.g. Microsoft, Logitech) that are within the Wi-Fi device
range (20-50 m). The device also enables the customer to remotely control
the wireless keyboard and thus control the target computer.
FinBluez
Elaman is developing the FinBluez – a product that enables agencies to do
various advanced attacks against Bluetooth devices like mobile phones,
headsets and computers. For example, FinBluez is able to record the audio
stream between a headset and a mobile phone or utilize common Bluetooth
headsets as audio bugs.

FinSpy
FinSpy is a professional Trojan horse that can be used by law enforcement
agencies to monitor the computer system of targetted persons that run a
Microsoft Windows operating system (Windows 98 to Windows Vista).
The package offers the capability to monitor one or multiple systems using a
centralized server and dedicated clients.
The FinSpy package can be used even by agents without advanced IT
technology knowledge as it provides a simple point-and-click user interface.
The FinSpy Trojan horse executable itself is fully customizable and will look
different on every target system. It also utilizes all up-to-date techniques to
hide itself and all its activities from the system and, therefore, is hard to
detect.
FinSpy Components:
FinSpy Client: The user interface that is used by the agents to get access
to the target’s system and gather information or control (e.g. reconfigure
or remotely delete) the FinSpy Target
FinSpy Server: Central server where all infected clients connect and
publish their availability and basic system information. The server is also
contacted by the FinSpy Client to get the infected target list
FinSpy Target: This is the package that is used for the infection and is
installed on the target system
FinSpy U3-USB Dongle: A U3 USB dongle that contains software to
deactivate all running Anti-Virus/Anti-Spyware software and installs the
FinSpy Target component with little or no user interaction
FinSpy Antidote: Software to detect and remove FinSpy Target that can
also prevent the installation
FinSpy Proxy: (Optional) A proxy that forwards connections between
FinSpy Target and FinSpy Server that can be used to have multiple active
public IP addresses and limit the possibility of detection by researchers
FinSpy Features:
Certificate based encryption
All communication and data is enciphered using RSA certificates.
Custom Executables
For each client, a customized executable will be created which prevents
detection by Anti-Virus and Anti-Spyware utilities.
File Access
The remote file system can be accessed and all files can be viewed, edited
and downloaded. Custom files can also be uploaded to the target system.
Key-logging
All keystrokes can be recorded to a file which enables FinSpy to even view
text that is sent through SSL or Skype sessions.
Password Sniffing
A password sniffer can be started in the background that collects all
passwords for plain-text protocols like POP3, IMAP, Samba Shares, FTP and
many more.

Webcam Recording
The webcam of the target system can be utilized to monitor the target person or
environment.
Microphone Recording
The microphone of the target system can be utilized to monitor the target person
or environment.
Timing based operations
All operations and functionality of FinSpy can be scheduled by days and hours.
Local Passwords
FinSpy can provide a list of local passwords for applications like Windows, E-Mail
clients, Messengers and many more.
E-Mail Dumping
E-Mails can be dumped to a file before they are sent in order to be able to analyze
even SSL enciphered mail traffic.
Chat Logging
Various instant messenger and chat protocols can be monitored. This includes
MSN, ICQ, IRC and Skype.
Auto-removal
FinSpy can remove itself automatically from a target’s system without leaving
traces if selected by an agent or scheduled by the configuration.
Live Configure
All options of FinSpy can also be configured at run-time and additional modules
can be loaded.
Live Update
The FinSpy Target itself can be updated to the newest version even at runtime
using the client’s software.
IP notification
When the IP address of the target system is changed, it will send the new
address to the centralized server.
Country Tracing
Using the IP address, the target’s location is traced and traveling is detected by
displaying the actual country, plus the previous countries where the target was
located.
Generic system information
Generic system information can be retrieved which includes installed software,
auto-run programs, etc.
Remote Command Shell
A remote command shell on the target’s system can be accessed to manually
execute custom commands.
Connect-back
FinSpy is able to create a reverse connection on arrival of a specially crafted
packet. This helps bypassing Firewalls and especially NAT-enabled environments
where the client does not have a public reachable IP address. FinSpy supports
Windows systems equal to and newer than Windows 98.

FinFly
FinFly is a transparent HTTP proxy that can modify content while it is being
downloaded.
It can be used to infect executables that are downloaded from a web server
with FinSpy or custom Trojan horses.
Using the configuration file, IP addresses can be selected which means that
only a certain range or a single address is going to be infected or a certain
range should be ignored by the proxy.
FinFly comes with a special loader that merges the Trojan horse with the
original executable. On execution, the Trojan gets installed, is removed from
the original and then the original executable gets executed. Using this
technique, most common malware detection mechanism of common AntiVirus/Anti-Spyware utilities can be bypassed.
Optionally, the proxy can be extended to modify any other file types and also
totally replace files while they are being downloaded.
FinFly supports Linux systems equal to and newer than 2.6. Windows
and BSD support can be added upon request.
FinFisher Hacking PC
The FinFisher Hacking PC consists of a robust notebook plus various hacking
equipment.

FinAudit
FinAudit is a 1 or 2 week professional penetration testing for a given network
to discover the possible vulnerabilities in systems and software and helps in
securing the network IT environment.
The audit can be done remotely and locally. A local audit should be always
considered to detect all attack vectors for local, physical and especially insider
attacks.
FinAudit includes a complete IT-based penetration test against the available
and publicly used infrastructure and all public and internal systems.
A complete audit and fixing of discovered vulnerabilities helps to prevent
attacks and information disclosure.
Single software can also be checked for vulnerabilities, including a full sourcecode analysis.
