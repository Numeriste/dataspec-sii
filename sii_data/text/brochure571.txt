AUDIOCLEAR
RAPID DEPLOYMENT LISTENING STATION
DNCS-3/R DIGITAL NOISE CANCELLING SYSTEM

AUDIOCLEAR

incorporates advanced signal processing algorithms specifically designed for the removal of
background noise from speech on a continuous and adaptive basis. This technology enables the recovery of voice
audio that is clear distinguishable and intelligible from signals that are, in many cases, unusable.
A major operational advantage of this technology is that, once connected, no operator adjustments are required as
the software "learns" the structure of the audio signal on a real-time basis. The necessary corrections to the signal
are then applied automatically to produce the best possible signal-to-noise ratio.
A VERSATILE MULTI-USE SYSTEM FOR USE AS A
SURVEILLANCE BASE STATION
This system is an excellent solution for long-term surveillance
applications, featuring line and microphone inputs, variable
noise suppression, and loudspeaker, head phone and record
outputs. It can be utilised in conjunction with monitoring
receivers, telephone recorders and any hard-wired
microphone or transducer system for superb real-time noise
reduction. Very long un-balanced microphone cables
ca n be utilised.
The unit is perfectly suited for rapid deployment and by
greatly
increasing
the
clarity of incoming
voice
communications, operators can listen with less fatigue and
greater concentration.
