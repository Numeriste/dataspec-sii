FIRST AID TO WOUNDED COMBATANTS ON THE BATTLEFIELD The user Interface

 

Statistical information: rendering ?rst aid to
wounded combatant during 40 minutes
after wounding enable to save about 60% of
wounded persons additionally.

Insurance charge per one combatant of the
UNO peacekeeping forces in region of
military con?icts in case of his decease is 108
000 Euro. In case of wounding, according to
severity and consequences of injury, insur-
ance charge is from to 108 000 Euro.

The main goal of the search system is to
signi?cantly increase the probability of the
combatants? survival after getting gunshot
wound on the battle?eld (realization of
so-called "golden hour?).

The goal is achievable due to the
following unique features of the
system:

2. Automatic portable injector which is
installed on the leg above knee.

3. Miniature optical pulse- and oxy-meter
are installed on the ear lobe to measure the
pulse parameters and oxygen dynamics in
the blood after the bullet hits the
combatant's body.

4. Two sensors connected to the comba-
tant's personal radio set; their role is to
identify the body?s orientation in space and
coordinates of the wounded combatant on
the battle?eld.

Information from all sensors is sent automati-
cally to the combatant?s personal radio set in
real time and automatically retransmitted to
the mobile hospital where data receipt and
processing mobile centre is located. The
centre is equipped with a special multi-
channel radio-receiver connected to the 
digital map of the region of interest with
colour markers corresponding to the
combatants? whereabouts in real time is
provided by software, it also includes the
program of automatic assortment of the
wounded combatants.

The operator in centre has a possibility to get
urgently about wounded

hit by bullets; 2) level of oxygen in the blood;
3) bodies?orientation; 4) bones or soft tissues

2. The sensors detecting human body orie-
ntation in space at the moment of its falling
have also tested.

3. The miniature computer pulsimeter and
telemetric counter of oxygen level in blood in
real time has been under testing yet.

4. The possibility of including unmanned
aerial vehicle (UAV) with the following
functions into the system has been examin-
ing now:

Wounded combatant is homing automatically;
- Infrared TV monitoring of the wounded
combatant detecting the blood on body;

- Retranslation of wounded combatant?s
vision to a hospital in real time;

- Medical remedies of ?rst aid (such as
portable oxygen generators, medicaments
etc.) are delivered to the group of combat-
ants (in case of necessity) by airlift.

Having digital map of region and timely
information about the wounded combatants
state and whereabouts it is possible to
provide manual UAV control from the remote
computer centre.

Potential system end users:

1. Militaryforces.

2. Police forces.

3. Emergency Control Ministry (ECM) forces.
4. Subdivisions of counter?intelligence
agencies, internalforces, anti?terrorist units.

It?s planning to conduct the complex system
testing in real tactical situation in March,
2011. Experimental group will be
anti?terrorist unit.

This system can be adapted for the customer
individually after purchasing. Upgrading
within customer?s requirements is available.
