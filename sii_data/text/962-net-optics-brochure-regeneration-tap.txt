4x1 10/100BaseT
Regeneration Tap
Net Optics 4x1 10/100BaseT Regeneration Taps solve the key physical layer challenges
of multi-device monitoring for 10/100BaseT networks. For a complete picture of network
health, these Taps connect up to four different network management and security devices
at any single 10/100BaseT network location.
Keep your intrusion detection and prevention systems, protocol analyzers, RMON probes,
and other security devices productive with a single Regeneration Tap. Maximize resources
and save on access points when multiple devices can monitor link traffic simultaneously
through a single Regeneration Tap.
The network port features Net Optics Zero DelayTM technology, ensuring that any loss of
power to the Tap is transparent to the network, and does not affect the flow of traffic
through the Tap – eliminating packet delay and loss as potential security issues.
Without an IP address, monitoring devices are isolated from the network, dramatically
reducing their exposure to attacks. However, the monitoring device connected to the Tap
still sees all full-duplex traffic as if it were in-line, including Layer 1 and Layer 2 errors.

Passive, Secure Technology

• Enables real-time, simultaneous monitoring of a single 10/100BaseT link with up to
four monitoring devices
• Provides complete full-duplex visibility at 10 or 100 Mbps without data stream
interference or introducing a point of failure
• Unique Zero Delay technology ensures every packet goes through without delay, even
if power is lost to the Tap
• Passes all traffic (including errors) from all layers for comprehensive troubleshooting
• No IP address is needed for the Tap or monitoring device, enhancing monitoring security
• Redundant power ensures monitoring uptime
