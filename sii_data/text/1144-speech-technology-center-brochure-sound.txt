SOUND STRETCHER
TI eXpressDSP compliant algorithm
Features
Sound Stretcher allows playback of speech in
variable fast or slow modes without distorting the
voice pitch, so that speech still sounds natural. It is
an algorithm of real time speech modification :
u Up to 3 times faster/slower - adjust speech tempo
according to your needs.
u Low resource consumption - even resource-limited
DSP-based devices (mobile equipment, PDAs, etc)
can be enabled.
u Language-independence - this algorithm can be
used for any language, regardless of speaker's
accent.
u And the most important feature of Sound Stretcher is
the simplicity of use for a developer with minimal
time and money Sound Stretcher may be
embedded in any application.

TI eXpressDSP (XDAIS) Compliance Benefits

u

u
u
u
u
u

Sound Stretcher is fully TI eXpressDSP
compliant algorithm and thus saving time and
money saving in building in any DSP solution.
This algorithm follows the run-time conventions
imposed by TI's implementation of the C prog
language.
This algorithm is re-entrant within a preemptive
environment (including time-sliced preemption).
All algorithm data references are fully
relocatable.
All algorithm code is fully relocatable.
This algorithm does not directly access any
peripheral device.
This algorithm does not include definitions
specific to a debug variant.

Metrics
Applications
Sound Stretcher may be applied for numerous tasks,
to mention just a few:
u Language acquisition devices - when slowed down,
speech is understood better
u Transcription equipment, the ability to slow down
speech and still hear coherent sentences makes
the task quicker and easier.
u Multimedia equipment, In general, anywhere,
where time matters, Sound Stretcher may be used
to adjust speech speed to match the required time
frame. E.g. Broadcasting advertising
