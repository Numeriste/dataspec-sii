Cloud Computing
Definitions
 Wikipedia:
“… the provision of computational resources on
demand via a computer network.”

 NIST:
“Cloud
“Cl d computing
ti iis a model
d l ffor enabling
bli convenient,
i t
on-demand network access to a shared pool of
configurable computing resources (e.g., networks,
servers,, storage,
g , applications,
pp
, and services)) that can
be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal
management effort or service provider interaction.”

Pros & Cons
 Significant cost savings possible

 Customer looses control over data

 Pay for need only, not for

 Network connections critical

Possibly better reliabilty
Possibly better security
Location independent
Device independent
Up-to-date services (e.g. patching
done by provider)
Scales very well

Cloud Computing
Legal Issues
 Location of storage, servers etc. might not be known
Might even not be known by the service provider himself
Location might change during usage
 But: Many large service providers have regional/local datacenters serving

customers in this region
 Which laws do apply?
The country where the customer is located?
The country of the service provider?
The country where the infrastructure is located?
One of the above depending on situation?
Situation might change even during one session
Compliance requirements (e.g. auditing, reporting)
Laws might even contradict each other

 Customer located in EU (Germany)
For the customer relation, German laws apply (probably)

Data is possibly stored in all DCs above and/or moved automatically
between them

Security Challenges
 System complexity
 (Shared) Multi-Tenant
Multi Tenant environment
 Internet-facing services (remote administration mandatory)
 Data protection
Data must be segregated for each customer
Logs/auditing/monitoring must include
even privileged users
Encryption of stored data preferrable

Cloud Computing
Security Advantages
 Staff specialization at cloud provider
 Platform strenght
more homogenous environment
easier to secure, patch & audit
mostly an advantage
advantage, but might be endangered by one specific threat
 Resource availability due to scalability
 Backup & Recovery
Especially if data is stored in diverse locations
 Mobile endpoints
No/minimal need to store sensitive data on mobile devices

Lawful Interception – LEAs Interest

More and more information is handled by the cloud
- one reason is exploding mobile access (iPhone, Android)

Cloud Computing
Lawful Interception – Fundamental Aspects
 In „classic“ LI, telecommunication services are intercepted (data in

motion)
Which cloud computing services are telecommunications?



Google Mail: yes
Dropbox: ?

 Data stored in the cloud (data at rest)
Which laws allow LEAs to access the data in the cloud?
Which data of which subscribers are covered by these laws?
Access to stored data typically not in real-time
How to access the data?

 Targets might use cloud services via access paths not intercepted

i
 End-to-end
IRI might be obtainable
CC only interceptable on the end-points
end points (CPE or cloud provider)
End-to-end encryption increasingly offered by cloud providers
Security enhancements (e.g. two-factor authentication by Facebook)
 Legal situation often very unclear
Easy for US-based LEAs
Diffi lt ffor non-US-based
Difficult
US b
d LEA
LEAs
Cloud providers often face contradicting laws

Cloud Computing
Lawful Interception in Clouds – Challenges 2/2
 Infrastructure of many clouds is technically quite autonomous
Virtualized servers


actual computing instance might change on the fly
Redundant storage


data typically stored in different locations, locations might change
on the fly

 Dynamics above are a fundamental aspect of clouds
At the same time, basics for some of the cloud advantages

p
and legal
g framework
 Conflicts between these technical aspects

Cloud Computing
Lawful Interception – Recent Developments
 LEAs can mostly access the data stored in clouds
But legal framework often unclear
Different/contradicting laws in different countries
No standardized access (yet)
Requests in US and Europe for easier access of LEAs to data
 Extensive privacy discussions in Europe
