• The development of this new Low
Noise Drilling set is the result of many
years of professional operational experience
• The complete system is stored in a
discreet briefcase to enable quick setup & user-friendly operation
• In hostage situations, knowledge is vital to a successful outcome and the
technique of low noise drilling allows
audio and visual intelligence to be
gained without alerting the hostage
takers
• Unlike other drills the C7 will successfully drill through a wide range of construction materials using the specially
developed main drills for long access
holes and pinhole drills for the final
breakthrough
We are able to offer a complete family of micro endoscopes and audio probes to complement the C7 System
