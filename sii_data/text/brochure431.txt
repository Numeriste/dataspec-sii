SDR Feeder
Real-time streaming of Session Detail Records

Automatic de-capsulation of tunneledl
encapsulated traffic
Operates on fragmented, duplicated,
de-sequenced packets
Operates on bidirectional and unidirectional
traffic

SDRs are customized with the ixQL language,
enabling users to select the information and
define the tuple
Formats:
CSV streaming over FTP or HTTP

SessionizerTM

Binary streaming with Qosmos ixSP
protocol over TCP or UDP

The Qosmos Sessionizer reassembles flows and
correlates them into sessions and sessions into
applications. The dynamic analysis of individual
flows and their combinations provide 360"
visibility of traffic behavior at the flow, session,
application, service and user levels.

ixStreamer

Open data and packet server enabling users
to optimize the communication between
ixMachine and their application
Real-time streaming of traffic attributes and
content with Qosmos ixSP protocol over TCP
or UDP

Deployment
Plug & play probe to feed your application
with traffic information

Filtering of attributes extracted and delivered

Connected in port mirroring/TAP mode with
no impact on traffic

Supports streaming of data and packets to a
remote or local host
Streaming of data to a local process (pipe)

Delivers traffic information into CDRs and
xDRs irrespective of the types of devices
present in the network infrastructure
