Recent years have seen a surge in hand held satellite telecommunications systems largely due to the
development of technology both in the handsets and also on the satellite. Because they are easy to use, portable
and can be used almost anywhere, they are the communications tool of choice for many criminals and terrorists.
Inmarsat Monitoring:
Inmarsat were the first to provide satellite based
communications networks and their Inmarsat M
and mini-M terminals are still very widely used.
The newer systems based on their Global Area
Network (GAN), concept provide facilities f o r
faster data communications.
Recently, collaboration w i t h ACeS h a s given
Inmarsat a hand-held voice terminal, IsatPhone,
to allow it to compete with Thuraya and Iridium.
Coverage of IsatPhone is currently Africa and a
large part of Asia, with little or no coverage of
Europe at the present time.
Like Thuraya, IsatPhone coverage of the Americas
is planned for the near future.

Thuraya Monitoring:
The Thuraya satellite network currently covers f r o m
Scandinavia, the UK and Spain in the West to the Far East
and Australasia in the East using two geostationary satellites.
The network will provide voice, SMS, fax and data over an
[-band radio path. T h e antenna on each Thuraya satellite
forms an array o f spot-beams. These are similar to the
cellular coverage of a GSM network, providing the antenna
gain necessary for a hand-held communications system
using a geostationary satellite.
Iridium Monitoring:
Iridium uses a network of 66 low earth orbit satellites to
provide full global coverage including all sea masses and the
North and South Poles. I t is the world's largest commercial
satellite network. T h e system uses 11 low-earth orbit
satellites in each of the 6 orbital planes and each satellite
communicates with its 4 nearest neighbours. U s e of spot
beams requires significant switching and control of calls. A
single call may be switched between several satellites in its
duration.

Thuraya
The Thuraya Tactical Monitoring System ( r
mounted into a rugged pell-case which receives the L-band transmissions
from both the satellite and handset. Designed as a portable system it is
ideal for vehicle based monitoring in the field. T w o antennas capture
transmissions from the satellite and handset which are converted to an
intermediate frequency before processing in the digital signal processing
engine.
The Thuraya Strategic Monitoring System (TSMS) uses a large dish
antenna to intercept the C-band downlink signals from the satellite to the
Thuraya ground station and a smaller antenna to intercept the L-band
downlink signals from the satellite to the handset. All communication in
both directions between handset and satellite is received by the system,
including locations of all handsets. U s i n g additional L-band receivers,
coverage can be extended to cover the whole C-band footprint.

TINS - Thuraya Tactical
Monitoring System

Inmarsat
Inmarsat M and mini-M terminals use the Inmarsat
3 family of satellites and, as with Thuraya, both
tactical and strategic monitoring solutions can be
provided.
Inmarsat IsatPhone terminals u s e t h e n e w
Inmarsat 4 satellites a n d transponders f o r
IsatPhone are currently installed on the EMEA and
Asia pacific satellites.

Inmarsat BGAN is the new high speed data service
which uses the Inmarsat 4 family o f satellites.
Komcept Solutions and its partners are currently
working on a solution for monitoring this service.
Inmarsat

Iridium
Due to the design of the network and the
number o f satellites, o n l y tactical
interception o f I r i d i u m i s possible.
Communication between satellite a n d
handset is on L-band and the Iridium
monitoring system uses a two channel
down-converter a n d d i g i t a l s i g n a l
processing engine to monitor separately
the up-link and down-link channels. The
signal processing u n i t carries o u t
registration o f t h e I r i d i u m signals,
identifying the satellite, spot-beam, subband, time-slot and frequency o f each
signal. A l l captured d a t a c a n b e
