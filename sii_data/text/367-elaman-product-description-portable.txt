Portable Modem Interception

Model 4001

The Model 4001 is a true portable modem
intercept solution to be used in operations
where direct access to the target lines is
required.
This unit can be deployed in the field close to
the target or installed on a permanent basis,
for example, in a monitoring center. Due to
the unique design of the physical line
interface
the
system
is
completely
undetectable by the target and is transparent
to all parties on the line. making it ideal for all
covert operations.

SYSTEM SUMMARY
The Model 4001 system is delivered as a complete turnkey solution, including all cables and
accessories. It consists of a high quality and specially designed PSTN line interface and a
lunchbox computer for recording and decoding. It is very easy to operate and it only needs a
few hours of training to use it at its fullest potential.
The system intercepts all dialup modem traffic on a two wire analog PSTN line, and has no
influence on normal voice or fax traffic on the intercepted target line.
V.90 and V.92 is supported but will be trained down to 33.600 from the interface box towards
the target.
The target line is connected in sequence to the line interface box that in turn connects to the
lunchbox computer; power it up and you are ready to go.

You can listen to any Voice over IP traffic. The audio player contains an automatic gain
control filter to enhance the audio.
With these advanced tools you are able to follow whatever the target is doing on the internet
and easily pinpoint any illegal activity.
Information can be copied to the built-in CD or DVD writer for presentation in court or other
purposes.

The intercepted traffic is decoded into readable information for access to a broad range
of tools for dealing with the intercepted data.

Keyghost Keystroke Capturing Device

Model 4008

The KeyGhost is powered by its own hi-tech internal chip and can store up to 2,000,000
keystrokes in non-volatile flash memory, which is a permanent memory that does not require
power to retain storage.
This enables the KeyGhost to operate completely independent of the hardware and operating
system that is running on the PC. These stored keystrokes are protected with state-of-the-art,
128-bit encryption.
When the KeyGhost fills up with keystrokes, the earlier keystrokes are dropped. Therefore, the
user will always have a record of the latest keystrokes on the log.

Figure 1: External KeyGhost Device
The KeyGhost plugs into the keyboard cable, or alternatively, it can be hardwired inside the
keyboard. It records all keystrokes from the moment the computer is turned on to the moment
it is turned off. It starts operating immediately and silently, recording all keystrokes.

ADVANTAGES OF KEYGHOST:
It picks up every keystroke – even those typed in the critical period
between computer switch on and the operating system being
loaded
It cannot be removed easily if it is hardwired inside the keyboard or
mounted on the motherboard
It has a capacity of up to 2,000,000 keystrokes
Impossible to disable from a remote location or using software alone
It is impossible for a computer to detect it
It is immune to magnetic fields, has no moving parts and is shock
resistant
Its access time is extremely fast
The chance of failure is very low compared to conventional media
like hard drives or CDROM discs, because it uses flash memory to
store data and has no moving parts
It is very user-friendly; users do not need to be computer experts to
install it, just plug in the device to the keyboard cable
The log cannot be modified in the KeyGhost. The log is an authentic
record of what was typed, and therefore, it can be used

Portable IP Monitoring

Model 4010

The ever increasing mobility of communications in our society with laptops, mobile phones,
WLAN and PDAs also has some drawbacks. The mobile criminal offender takes advantage of
gaps in the criminal prosecution, like monitoring of WLAN-spots in internet-cafes, hotel rooms
and at airports. With Model 4010 we want
to help close these gaps.
Model 4010 is a portable system for
recording, reconstructing and evaluating IPdata and their applications, e.g. email, websessions, chat.
Model 4010 supports surveillance and
S.W.A.T. teams to receive relevant
information immediately on location and
guarantees access.
Model 4010 read the data, filters it
according to predefined filter criteria (depending on the specific usage and the legal regulations),
adds a timestamp to the data and saves it in raw format in a database. Using the Analyzer User
Interface the data can be reconstructed und evaluated – online or offline, residential or on
location. For archiving purposes the saved raw data can be exported automatically or manually
via FTP to already existing archiving media. Re-importing of archived raw data is also possible.
Model 4010 consist of three functional parts. The recording of the raw data, picked up from
different kinds of communication lines, the database management for internal organizational
purposes of this data and the reconstruction function to analyze and evaluate the recorded IPbased data.
Intelligence for a better world
The Internet has produced a veritable flood of
communication options, which are also being used by
criminal offenders.
We are an innovative provider of technology and services for
monitoring, recording and reconstructing telecommunication
data for carriers and law enforcement agencies. Our service
concept enables carriers and Internet Service Providers
(ISPs) to meet their statutory obligations in the most costeffective way. With our Monitoring Center and its product
line, state-of-the-art solutions are available for law
enforcement agencies to reconstruct, analyze and archive all
kinds of communication data (voice, facsimile, modem and
IP-data). Elaman solutions are based strictly on the statutory
specifications of the country concerned. In Germany, for
instance, these are embodied in the Telecommunications
Monitoring Ordinance.

Computer Keyboard Remote Monitoring System Model 4012
INTRODUCTION
The Model 4012 system monitors activity on the
keyboard of a target computer, stores the
keystroke activity and transmits collected data to
a remote location. The system consists of the
Model 4012 T micro transmitter, which is
installed in the target keyboard and detects the
code of each keystroke. The Model 4012 T then
stores the codes and periodically transmits the
codes in short data bursts to the Model 4012 R
receiver. Model 4012 R supports four basic
operational strategies:
Stores up to 2.5 million key codes in the Model 4012 R receiver
memory. The Model 4012 R can then be removed or accessed
to retrieve the key codes
Displays the received key codes directly on a PC through a
serial connection
Re-launches the data using the Model 4012 GSM module for
real time transmission or scheduled download
Downloads the key codes with the Model 4012 UHF link and
the Model 4012 DL. An operator within the UHF link radio range
of the target can quickly download the key codes using the
hand-held Model 4012 DL. The retrieved data is stored in the
Model 4012 DL for subsequent display and analysis
The system operation and functional parameters can be controlled and viewed using the Model
4012 SW software, or through SMS messages. The Model 4012 SW software filters and
elaborates visual analysis key code data without any modification of the original text.

FEATURES
Special features built into the Model 4012 DL
simplify usage by:
quickly downloading the key codes
assisting in the identification of the correct
connection points for the Model 4012 T

Computer Sniffer Activity Tools

Model 4035

The Model 4035 computer sniffer is a highly effective
software tool that can monitor activity on the computer
in which it is installed and send that information to a
collection point. The Model 4035 was created as a
software micro-spy with key logging, mouse logging,
screenshots, photo logging and voice logging functions.
To maintain secrecy, the Model 4035 remains passive in
the system; in other words it never takes the initiative,
but simply reacts to other events or situations to hide
itself behind something that the user already expects.
Even during communication it never attempts to make a
connection, but continuously monitors the state of the
connection to intercept the moment when the
connection is available.

COLLECTED INFORMATION
The Model 4035 deals with different types of information, mainly on the monitored PC. In
particular:
It records any session data, i.e. user name, timestamp, computer name, etc
It captures any activity on the keyboard and also provides an automatic transposition for
special keys or other phenomena connected with keyboard layout
When first installed, it refreshes itself remotely and silently, without any further external
action on-site
It can produce a video-screenshot and send it over the net to be reproduced as a simple
jpeg. Screenshots are taken silently, either at specific time intervals or during particular
events
If it detects an installed webcam, it can use it to take user's photo
Audio capturing from the PC microphone is useful to intercept VoIp (i.e. Skype)
All the info (keyboard activity log, screenshot, photos, etc.) is sent in an encrypted manner
to a specific target address using any standard protocol

HOW IT WORKS
The software is composed of a silent transmitter and an admin tool. The system works by
installing the transmitter on the target PC and using the admin tool at the listening site. The
transmitter sends the captured information through a pre-designated mail server, either via
email or other protocols, based on various opportunities for installation and configuration. The
information from the transmitter is sent in encrypted format.

Active GSM Portable Interceptor

GA 900

INTRODUCTION
The GA900 was developed for services without access to the GSM-switches. Interception
refers to GSM900 and GSM1800. The GSM Test System GA900 is a monitoring system
featuring the following functions:
Scan Mode: Identification of active mobiles within the detection range of GA900
Search Mode: Search for dedicated mobiles
Jam Mode: Blocking of mobiles
Report Mode: Evaluation of the database by data filters
Optional directional finding of the target.
The following identifications are intercepted by GA900 even when the mobile is in the idle
mode:
Determination of the International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI)
Determination of the International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI )
Determination of the telephone number of the called party
Call to/from mobile for verification

MODULES OF GA900
The GSM Test System GA900 consists of the following modules (fig. 1):
Commercial GSM Tx/Rx antenna
Rx/Tx- (receive/transmit-) module
Signaling unit
Cell monitor
Notebook PC (controller)
Power supply
Cable set
Optional installation kit for cars
Optional mobile portable case

OPERATION
The control computer, i.e. notebook, with the operator display (MMI) is based on standard-PC
components. A modern state-of-the-art IBM-compatible PC with the operating system Windows
2000 is used. All recorded data is stored in files on the hard disk. An object oriented data base
management system is integrated to make the data management more comfortable.
In the display of the Scan-Mode all the currently monitored subscribers are listed with their IMSI
and IMEI. Additional data about the owner of the SIM-card, if edited by the operator of GA900,
can be displayed by real-time operation of the database.
Furthermore, time and location of the first interception can be displayed.
With the help of the database, additional detailed information about the subscriber and his
identity can be displayed. It is possible, for example, to request time and location of former
interceptions from the database.

GA 900

FUNCTIONALITY
The determination of the IMSI and IMEI via the air interface is possible only by a method, which
simulates a base station inside a GSM network.
This base station (GA900) transmits a beacon frequency with modified parameters. All mobiles
in the vicinity of the simulated base station will now sequentially log-in on GA900 and it is
possible to request IMSI and IMEI. This procedure is like a normal location update from one cell
to another and therefore not noticeable to the subscriber.
IMSI and IMEI are stored as a list in a data file. If the Access Class was specified, it is possible
to store the AC with IMSI and IMEI to speed up the following search processes.
For the duration the MS is logged to GA900, the MS is separated from the normal network.
Calls originated by the mobile are now received by GA900 and the respective telephone number
of the party called is displayed. However, the call will not be transferred to the normal network.
These calls are responded by the Test System either by the operator of GA900 or by tones
indicating that the subscriber is engaged or out of operation. Especially with the test extension
the call can be established and the duplex voice channel can be intercepted. Mobile terminated
calls cannot be intercepted.
After registration of IMSI/IMEI non-relevant MS will be released to the GSM network. These MS
will be separated for a short time from the net.

GA2G

Leveraging the success of GA900 to next generation speed and miniature hardware R&S is
extending the mobile radio monitoring portfolio of its renowned GSM Test Systems GA900 and
GA900M with a new family member -- the GA2G. This new GSM monitoring tool is a very small
and lightweight test system for the detection of subscriber presence and determining their
identities.
Providing two active virtual BTS-components, this highly portable multi band test system, which
is the size of standard cabin luggage, allows special operations in more than one network Multichannel at a time.
The usage of up to eight time slots per
transceiver, which increases the acquisition
speed to the maximum, together with Modern

Radio Monitoring DF Portable

TMS 100/200

The Transportable Monitoring and Direction Finding Systems R&S TMS100 and R&S TMS200
are optimized for mobile use at rapidly changing sites with unknown radio scenarios. They are
designed for the following monitoring and DF tasks from 20 MHz to 1300 MHz, with an
extendable range from 10 kHz (500 kHz for DF) to 3000 MHz. All measurement tasks can be
performed either automatically (scheduled) or interactively.
The key advantage of transportable systems over fixed monitoring stations is that once the
allotted tasks at one site have been completed, a transportable system can be moved to
another site, and quickly set up. Owing to the system’s compact design, it can even be installed
on roofs or in difficult terrain. The antennas can be mounted on tripods.
For mobile remote-controlled and portable use:
Reliable solution for monitoring and direction finding between 20 MHz and 1300 MHz, with
extendable range from 10 kHz (500 kHz for DF) to 3000 MHz
Compact and cost-effective
Different power supplies available: 100 V to 240 V AC or 11 V to 32 V DC
Can easily be carried by two persons
Quickly ready for use because of the very short setup time
Can be operated up to 24 hours per day
Controlled via Monitoring Software R&S ARGUS
Transportable monitoring systems, either car-installed or portable, can perform all the
measurement tasks usually associated with fixed or remote-controlled monitoring stations and
have the extra advantages of being much more cost-effective and capable of changing location
rapidly. This means that the coverage area of a network comprising fixed and remote-controlled
monitoring stations can be expanded according to user requirement. No more than two persons
are needed to the carry the system, which is on a portable rack.

Radio Monitoring DF Portable

TMS 100/200

The transportable system can be installed in all vehicle types and can be used as a mobile
monitoring system. The portable rack containing the equipment can easily be fixed to the
vehicle with four screws.
Special fixtures are used to mount the DF and monitoring antennas on the roof of the vehicle.
GPS receiver and compass can be added to the system so that location and bearing of the
vehicle can automatically be determined. The transportable system installed in vehicles can also
be remote-controlled. This is usually done via GSM/GPRS 900/1800 links. The system can be
used even if the vehicle is moving. Antennas which are capable of withstanding the resulting
forces must be mounted on the vehicle.
Operation as an unattended fixed station and operation as an attended fixed station are
essentially the same. Routers and modems, as additional components, are integrated into the
transportable systems to enable remote control.
Analog or digital dialing or leased lines or GSM/GPRS 900/1800 links are used with a data rate of
at least 9.6 kbps. A control station can be created from a PC with the appropriate software, a
router and a modem, or even from a transportable system when provided with the necessary
communications equipment.
Direction finding can be performed with at least two transportable systems.
