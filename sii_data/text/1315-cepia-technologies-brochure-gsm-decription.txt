GSM Key-recovery
SPARK-seriesTMproducts deliver high performance GSM A511 and GSM A512,
session key recovery in packages tailored
for server or mobile use in operational
environments. The systems are designed to
run in both passive and active interception
scenarios.
SPARK utilises a mix of rugged COTS
equipment, integrated in a scalable and
modular system with proprietary rugged
hardware developed by CEPIA. The system
has an open API structure to allow integration with various types of receivers and task
allocators.
200+ session key recoveries per second
with close to 100% success rate in a
multi-message scenario. The balance
between performance and success rate is
adjustable on the fly.

TECHNOLOGIES

The system can work with both key-stream
requests (4 consecutive frames) and
cipher-stream requests* with CEPIA's own
plain-text predictor. Plain-text prediction
works even in networks with random fillers.
Designed to work with no or minimal setup
before operational.
Designed for continuous 2417 operation in
tactical operational environments. Cluster
option available.
System is Ican be integrated with most
existing and future GSM-capable intercept
receivers.

GSM Decryption
SPARK-seriesTM

SparkPlugTMis the best selling unit in the
Spark-seriesTM,offering both a normal
version capable of simultaneous active and
passive operation, and a active only 'light'
version.
Same small lU 19" form-factor as the
MobileSparkTM(Ultra) Light units.

This unit redefines GSM decryption, with
massive performance, low price and small
sizelweightlpower consumption. With the
MobileSparkTMit is possible to decrypt all
captured traffic even from high-performance
SDRs that capture all channels in GSM
spectrum. This enables new concepts of
operations.
Key figures (normal I extended):
Up to 70 I140 keyslsec
Up to 99,5% single-message success rate
Less than 1.5 sec latency, 800ms average
2 1 2+1U 19" rack, 35cm deep
9-32VDC 500 1800W power (max)
Ships with 85-264VAC power-supply

MobileSparkTM
[Ultra] Light
This highly capable decrypt unit is the ideal
compromise between size, performance and
ruggedness. Its modest size of only 1U and
low power consumption allows for almost
any installation. Thanks to its superb build
quality with harsh operational environments
in mind the MobileSparkTM(Ultra) Light will
provide a high number of keys per second
exactly where you need it the most. Being
subject to constant shocks in a vehicle or
vibrations onboard an airborne platform is
well within the limits for this unit.

The SparkServerTMis a clusterable unit
delivering massive performance from a
central location, at an industry leading
pricelperformance.
Key figures:
Up to 200 keyslsec per unit
Up to 99,8% single-message success rate
Less than 1.5 sec latency, 800ms average
2x 2U 19" rack, 65cm deep

SparkPlugTMEmbedded
The embedded SparkPlugTMis the latest
addition to the Spark-SeriesTMand
physically the smallest, which makes it the
preferred choice for highly mobile, portable
and even body-worn applications. It comes
in two versions, one active only version and
a passivelactive version.
Can also be delivered as PCB.
Key figures (active I passive):
Up to 1 I2 keyslsec
