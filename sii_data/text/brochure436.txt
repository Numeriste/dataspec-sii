ASC can quickly load and create a clone SIM in seconds. A
'cloned' SIM card has the benefit of holding all the correct data
from the evidential SIM, but is radio inactive so will protect the
handset evidence by blacking a network connection during
analysis.
There are two methods of creating a done SIM usingMC:
