Interception at 100 Gbps
and more

Jerome Tollet, CTO, Qosmos
October 2011

Challenges for LEAs
Facts
Exponential Growth of Throughput
Emergence of 40 Gbps interfaces
Greater number of interceptions
More details needed to investigate means
more data to process

Consequence
Higher complexity of technical
implementation
Higher cost
Lower efficiency of analysts flooded by
data

Simplistic approach not sustainable
Simplistic approach
Horizontal scaling: Multiply serveurs as fast as traffic increases
To find targets in the growing volume of traffic

Impact of the simplistic approach
Multiply processing costs
Multiply storage costs
Makes investigation more complex and slower because more data needs to be
analysed by Agents

Good News: 90% of the growth is composed of non-relevant
traffic

 Email + webmail + Instant
Messaging + VoIP is
stable with less than 2%

A Selective Approach for Interception Is Required
Focus processing capacity on relevant traffic category
Not all traffic is relevant for packet inspection
Video and entertainsment
Games

Triggers are usually set on very specific traffic categories
Email
Do you send more emails because your connection is upgraded from 10 Mbps to 100 Mbps?
VoIP
Authentication
These protocols generates stable traffic volumes

Focus processing capacity on relevant packets
In a session, only a small amount of packets contain relevant information
Email, webmail, IM, VoIP, authentication, SMS, MMS account for 2% of the
traffic
Many packets are even empty!
