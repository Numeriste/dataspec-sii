Midas System – System Overview

Overview

ROLE AND PURPOSE
The MIDAS System has one main central role. That is the accurate collation and storage of
intelligence data for inclusion in a central Database from one location. This Database, in the full
MIDAS System, is stored in a minimum of three locations on an isolated Network for security
and System redundancy. The System is capable of Database information replication, which is
done manually to ensure that the replication process does not take necessary operational
bandwidth from the plethora of communication channels that can be available to the System in
the updating process.
The main Information Transportation and Intelligence Data pre-processing Application, which is
incorporated operationally within the Central Database Application, is used for the processing of
Media into the PC from various Internal, External and Communication Channel sources, before
being directed into the Central Database. It can be viewed as the Data processing vessel
between the outside world and the Central Database, although it is not the only Data processing
medium.
The System is tailored to each customer's defined requirements, which can include the
following:
External Camera Equipment with a USB, Firewire, DV, Composite or S Video
External Audio signals, Stereo or Mono, Jack or RCA
Media Data Presented on a CD, DVD or Standard Memory Device
Media Data Transferred to the System via Telecommunication Channels
Documents Presented on a CD, DVD or Standard Memory Device
Documents Transferred to the System via Telecommunication Channels
Files Presented on a CD, DVD or Standard Memory Device
Files Transferred to the System via Telecommunication Channels
Telecommunication Transportation Method Capabilities, dependant upon Telecommunications
System available to the Client that are requested in the MIDAS System design, include: ADSL,
ISDN, PSTN, Satcom – Inmarsat, GSM/GPRS/3G, WiFi, Bluetooth, Ethernet including Fiber
Optic, E1.
The MIDAS System has been developed to incorporate many different Communication
Interception Methods to facilitate the requirement for the gathering of Intelligence information
at all costs. These include Telecommunication Interception and Recording, IT System Data
Interception, Decoding and Recording, the use of many Analogue and Digital “Bugs”, Mobile
Phone and SIM Card Readers.
The MIDAS System incorporates Printers, Scanners, Fax, Headphones, Speaker Systems and
Monitors for the live viewing and handling of Data, as and when it arrives, and facilitating an
appropriate method of information dissemination to interested and involved parties or agencies.
The MIDAS System allows live Audio/Video Data transfer links between the HQ and the
External Surveillance Units during operations, facilitating the operational control capability of the
HQ location on the operation. It should be noted that this facility, its quality and speed, is
determined by the characteristics of the Communication Channel employed to establish the
connection.

Midas System – System Overview
THE MIDAS SYSTEM INCLUDES:

Overview

Internet and IT Data Interception – This enables the MIDAS system to be used for Internet
interception and Data decoding at a local level for Ethernet, Bluetooth, WiFi, PSTN, ISDN, ADSL,
Internet interception and decoding, to enable Information gathering. This facility is still under
development.
Mobile Phone Interception and Call Re-Routing/Recording – This enables mobile phone
voice and data interception and caller identity discovery and disguising. The system can gather
mobile phone network data, record telephone conversations and intercept and record SMS
transmissions. The system can be controlled and monitored remotely, and calls can be
instigated by the recorder.
Mobile Phone and SIM Card Reading – The MIDAS System incorporates a mobile phone and
SIM card reader.
Remote Live Video Monitoring – The MIDAS System incorporates a live video link facility
which can be contacted over a clients chosen telecommunications medium.
Ghost Phones – The MIDAS System incorporates the use of ghost mobile telephones for the
gathering of intelligence data.
Remote Micro Bug Monitoring – This is a complex system of mains, line, RF, GSM and
telephone bugs, all accessible through a PSTN phone line from anywhere in the world. This
facilitates remote bugging. This is for covert installation within the target building or location.
Key logging – A complex key logging system, incorporating RF and GSM communications to
facilitate remote monitoring of a computers keyboard. Key ghost allows an external connection
for key logging. Various software packages are also available to e-mail key logging files to a
remote location.
Tracking and Remote Control and Recording – Although designed to be a tracking system
and a GSM audio recorder, this equipment is in fact so much more. Signal re-routing and alerts
are just one of the advanced features that can be utilized for intelligence gathering. This
equipment also interfaces with other equipment to make more advanced products.
Micro Audio and Video Recorders – The MIDAS System incorporates a range of covert audio
and video recorders that generate untamperable data for intelligence gathering.
MEDIA Streaming – MIDAS incorporates a media streaming facility which means that at the
TCP/IP level of network connection, and with the appropriate media encoding session initiated,
network participants can view live video from sources with an associated time delay of between
5 to 10 seconds, which is inherent with the use of such technology. The quality of the video, as
ever, is dependent upon the speed of the telecommunication channel being employed.
MC Integration – Midas can be integrated into a GSM/PSTN monitoring system
Video Enhancement System – One of the most professional video enhancement systems in
the world.
Audio Enhancement – One of the worlds most advanced audio enhancement and processing
systems.

MIDAS is a revolutionary computer interface system designed to control incoming Intelligence
Information direct from surveillance operations or from post operational activities.
MIDAS can control GSM tracking systems, transmitted video signals from GSM modules,
enhance audio recordings and transfer information between the IntelliBase intelligence
database, as well as updating all the databases in operation with the latest intelligence.
MIDAS Control of the Quick Enhance Professional Audio Filtration System, allows the operator
to filter out extraneous sounds, noises and music to allow the full recorded information to be
heard for evidential purposes and operational tasking.

MIDAS Control of GSM Tracking Systems makes life easier for the control of surveillance
operations and vehicles, under surveillance, during long- or short-term operations.
MIDAS can individually control up to 100 target transmitters, giving the operator the entire GPS
mapping coordinates and positioning on the local map display. It may also be possible to
monitor audio from inside the vehicle, if fitted.
