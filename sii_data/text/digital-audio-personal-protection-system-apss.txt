Digital Audio Personal Protection System APSS 2000-k
Description
The APSS 2000-k is a new personal protection and receiver system constructed using SMD
technology for the VHF-BOS band. The APSS 2000-k works in both “clear” (narrow-band FM) mode
and in crypto mode. In the latter mode data transmission is achieved with a data rate of
40 kBit/sec.
The APSTX 2301 transmitter is fitted with a frequency synthesizer and allows manual frequency
adjustment in 10 kHz steps via miniature DIL switch. A socket for an external microphone is provided.
The receiver unit consists of a high-quality scanner/receiver with an add-on decoder board.
If required, existing receivers can be retrofitted (MVT 7200, AR 3000A, AR 5000).
