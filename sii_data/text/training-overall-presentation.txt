Integrated Intelligence
• Power is of little use without good, timely and accurate
intelligence
• Despite huge budgets and enormous effort, the intelligence
community’s super-powers still get it spectacularly wrong
• The key is not in capacity or even in the use of technology
• The key is in the Integration of intelligence from all sources and
the Integration of its exploitation
• Integrated Intelligence training offered from Elaman
• It is applicable today to deal with an equally pernicious threat
from Islamic fundamentalists and internationally sponsored
terrorism
• It is not a ‘magic bullet’
• It is an intelligence force multiplier
