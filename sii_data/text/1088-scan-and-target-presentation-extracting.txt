contact@scanandtarget.com

Unlike solutions based on simple keywords or semantic, our technology
takes into account the different alterations and variants of
expressions to analyze the content:
 Small/ capital letters use
 Letters repetition (vvviiiagrrra for example)
 Orthographical variations (vi@gra, vlagra, v1@gra, v149r4)
 Missing letters in some cases (v|agra, v agra…)
 Word alteration whatever the use of non alpha symbol (v.i.a.g.r.a,
v_i°ag#r:a, v-iagra, viagr"a...)
 Phonetic alterations
 SMS and IM languages
 And the combination of these variations
The solution is available in English and French and Spanish and
Arabic (MSA + dialects, Arabic alphabet + transliteration).

The solution is based on a smart engine that rates not just single words
but the entire content as it passes through the filtering engine. Words
are therefore placed in context to extract meaning
The solution applies detailed thematic thesauruses - our Smart
Wordbooks. Filters are categorized to allow customers to fine-tune the
analysis (Terrorism/Drugs/Violence, etc.) according to their needs
Additional analysis layers: sentiment analysis, questions detection…
Proprietary scoring technology tailored to short digital text contents
Using a powerful and accurate conditional analysis system, our
customers experience a very low level of false positives (between 0,05%
to 0,001% in average)

Arabic principles
http://scanandtarget.com/

-

contact@scanandtarget.com

• Arabic is used to describe 3 different forms of the same
language:
– Classical Arabic: used in the Qur’an and classical literature
– Modern Standard Arabic (MSA):
 no one’s native spoken language any more
 Form of Arabic taught in schools and used in newspapers, books, sermons, TV…
 The most widely understood type of Arabic used in conversation between
educated Arabs from different countries

– Colloquial or Dialectal Arabic: national or regional varieties derived
from Classical Arabic, which constitute the everyday spoken language

Arabic dialects
http://scanandtarget.com/

-

contact@scanandtarget.com

• There are a number of
Arabic dialects that are
spoken in the Arabian
peninsula, North Africa
and the Middle East;
most of which largely
differ from one another
• Dialects are a mixture of
the native or indigenous
languages and Arabic
• Many of these dialects
are mutually
incomprehensible

Transliteration
http://scanandtarget.com/

-

contact@scanandtarget.com

• Transliteration is the romanization of Arabic
– From ‫قهوة‬

to Gahwa (Coffee)

• Problem: written Arabic is normally
unvocalized , i.e., the vowels are not written
out, and must be supplied by a reader familiar
with the language

Arabic chat alphabet
http://scanandtarget.com/

-

contact@scanandtarget.com

• The Arabic chat alphabet (Arabish or Arabizi) is
used to communicate in the Arabic language over
the Internet or for sending messages via mobile
phones when the Arabic alphabet is unavailable
• Arabic letters are replaced by letters that are
phonetically equivalent
• Arabic letters that have no Latin phonetic
counterpart are represented by numbers, or
numbers in conjunction with an accent mark

• A web or mobile conversation is a thread of
messages between 2 or more persons
• Analysis is first performed at message level for
contextual alerts
• When an alert is detected, the associated
discussion thread is again analyzed to:
• Increase accuracy and precision
• Extract investigation elements (names, places,
nationality, places…)
