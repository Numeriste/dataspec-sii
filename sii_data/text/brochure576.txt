Key Functionality

Full GPRS, SMS and GSM Data Communications
providing worldwide operational support for data •
and voice communications. The M2P Personal •
Locator is fully equipped for personal safety and
security applications with
a one touch personal •
alarm and man down alarm. Both activate alarms to •
the CP2 software and voice communications for
alarm verification.
•
The M2P Personal Locator can also be used for
location monitoring applications using the Log On or
Log Off Status function and one touch position
storage. The large capacity internal Position Log can
store up to 32,512 positions for off line analysis and
reporting via the CP2 software program.
In the event of an alarm activation an emergency
voice call can be automatically activated allowing
Silent Listening-in support. Position and status mes- •
sages are transmitted during the emergency voice
call.

•

Location data can either be logged in the internal
Position Log and/or the position, status and/or cell ID
transmitted to the CP2 software at defined intervals •
or on selected triggers.

Activated by motion the M2P Personal Locator·
requires minimal user involvement to operate. The
motion sensor intelligence combined with multiple
power modes ensures the maximum operational life- •
cycle between recharging.
Supporting Geo Fencing and limited route deviation
on 3D GPS fixes the M2P Personal Locator can
both monitor and alert in the event of any activity in
unauthorised or unsafe locations.
