Mounting the SG810 in an Equipment Rack
The SG810 is designed to fit into a standard telco-style or four-post cabinet style
equipment rack.
The SG810 ships with the rack-mounting ears installed.

Rack Mounting Notes
Read the following notes before rack-mounting the SG810:
•

Elevated Operating Temperature—If installed in a closed or multi-unit rack
assembly, the operating ambient temperature of the rack environment may be
greater than the ambient room temperature. Therefore, consideration should
be given to installing the equipment in an environment compatible with the
maximum ambient temperature specified by the manufacturer.

•

Reduced Air Flow—Installation of the equipment in a rack should be such
that the amount of air flow required for safe operation of the equipment is not
compromised.

•

Mechanical Loading—Mounting of the equipment in the rack should be such
that a hazardous condition is not achieved due to uneven mechanical loading.

•

Circuit Overloading—Consideration should be given to the connection of the
equipment to the supply circuit and the effect that overloading of the circuits
might have on overcurrent protection and supply wiring. Appropriate
consideration of equipment nameplate ratings should be used when
addressing this concern.

•

Earthing (Grounding)—Reliable earthing of rack-mounted equipment should
be maintained. Particular attention should be given to supply connections
other than direct connections to the branch circuit (for example, use of power
strips).

Attach the SG810 to the equipment mounting rack:

1 Position the SG810 into the equipment rack so that the ears of the brackets
align with the holes in the front of the rack.

2 Use equipment-rack screws to mount the SG810 to the equipment rack.
Figure 1-3 shows an SG810 flush-mounted on a Telco equipment rack.

rack

Figure 1-3: SG810 Attached to a Telco Equipment Rack

Attaching the Cable Management Support
The cable management support routes network serial cables to avoid tangling.
Fasten the cable management support to the back of the system as follows:

1 Position the cable management support at the back of the system on the right;
secure it with a 6-32 x 1/4 flathead screw at the side.

Chapter 2: Configure an SG810
You need to configure an SG810 the first time you power it on to set the basic
network parameters and to make sure that the SG810 hardware and software are
working properly.

Overview of First-Time Configuration
There are four ways to configure a SG810 the first time you power it on. Each of
these methods of configuring a SG810 let you make the basic network settings
required to test the connection and functionality.
Configuration
Method

Front Panel

Description
Use the front-panel LCD and buttons.
(This is the quickest and easiest way to do a first-time configuration.)
To use the front panel method, go to “Configuring the SG810 with
the Front Panel Features” on page 21.

Serial Console

Use a direct connection between the system and a PC, or a serial
terminal, or a stand-alone serial console terminal.
To use the serial console connection, go to “Initial Configuration
Using a Direct Serial Port Connection” on page 40.

Web Browser

Use a Web browser. To use this method for SGOS 5.1.1.x and later,
you must first configure the IP address of the SG810 using the serial
console or front panel. Blue Coat recommends using the Web
browser configuration method if you are running SGOS 5.1.1.x or
later.
To use the Web browser configuration method, go to “Initial
Configuration with a Web Browser” on page 29.

P/N 231-02814

SG810 Installation Guide

page 19

Configuration
Method

Remote
Configuration

Description
You can use this method if your appliance is running SGOS 4.2.2.x or
later. The remote configuration method is not supported for
appliances running 5.1.1.x or later.
This method uses two people to remotely configure the
appliance—one who enters the configuration parameters from a
remote location and another who places the SG810 into the network
and finalizes the configuration by clicking a generated URL.
To use the remote configuration method, go to “Configuring the

SG810 from a Remote Location” on page 57.
After completing the first-time configuration, you must log on to the system and
use the command-line interface (CLI) or the Management Console graphical user
interface to fully configure the system. First-time configuration is designed only
to make sure that the SG810 hardware and software are working properly.
Refer to the Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide for
information on how to fully configure the software. Download the Blue Coat

Section B: Placing the SG810 into the Network
This procedure describes a typical scenario for placing the SG810 into your
network. Use this procedure for the following circumstances:
•

You have already completed an initial configuration on the SG810.

•

You are going to complete an initial configuration on the SG810 using a direct
serial port connection or a remote Web browser setup.

The following instructions are an example of a typical network scenario—placing
the SG810 between the LAN and a router or firewall connected to the WAN. If
you do not know how to place the SG810 into your own network, consult with
your IT administrator. For less common network configurations, such as using
WCCP or a Layer 4 switch, refer to the Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and
Management Guide.
To Place the SG810 into the Network:

1 Connect the SG810 to the WAN—connect one end of an Ethernet cable
(straight or crossover depending on your network topology) to one of the
SG810’s Ethernet ports (either one). Connect the other end to the router or
firewall connected to the WAN.

2 Connect the SG810 to the LAN—connect one end of an Ethernet cable
(straight or crossover depending on your network topology) into the other
Ethernet port on the SG810. Connect the other end to the LAN (such as a PC
or a hub).

3 Verify that the network link is established by checking the network
connection LEDs at the back of the SG810. If the network connection is
functioning, the left-hand LED on each connection glows green.

10 (Optional) Secure the serial port: select Secure the Serial Port and enter the
password. Do not select Password is in hashed format unless the password is
already in a valid hashed format.
The serial port allows you to configure and access the SG810 using a serial
cable. This can pose a security risk, because anyone with access to the
appliance can reconfigure the SG810 settings. This step allows you to set a
password on the serial console setup, allowing only authorized personnel the
ability to reconfigure the appliance.

WARNING! If you set the serial console password and then lose the
password, you must restore the appliance to its original factory
defaults if you want to access the Management Console or CLI
(see “Resetting the SG810 to Factory Defaults” on page 85.)

Section D: Initial Configuration Using a Direct Serial
Port Connection
This section describes how to configure the SG810 using a direct serial port
connection. Before you can configure the SG810 using the serial port connection,
you must place the SG810 into the network as described in “Placing the SG810 into
the Network” on page 28.
A PC, serial terminal, or a stand-alone serial console terminal can be used to
configure an SG810 the first time you power it on. Use the serial console setup to
configure the following basic network information:
• IP address

• Subnet mask

• Gateway address

• DNS address

• Console username
and password

• Enable password

You can also configure a bridge or a forwarding host, or you can restrict access to
the SG810 to a particular IP address or set of IP addresses.

PC Note:

If the PC is using standard serial port settings, you should have
a problem-free connection. You can run into problems, though,
if there are non-standard PC serial port settings.

The serial port connection setup differs by model:
•

If your SG810 is running 4.2.2.x, complete the procedure described in
“4.2.2.x—Configuring the SG810 Using a Direct Serial Port Connection:” on
page 41.

•

If your SG810 is running 5.1.1.x, complete the procedure described in
“5.1.1.x—Configuring the SG810 Using a Direct Serial Port Connection:” on
page 49.

Section E: Configuring the SG810 from a Remote
Location

Important: The remote configuration procedure pertains only to 4.2.2.x or
later. If you are running 5.1.1.x or later, you must configure the
SG810 using the Web Setup Wizard or the serial console. See
“5.1.1.x—To Configure the SG810 Using the Setup Wizard:” on page 37
and “5.1.1.x—Configuring the SG810 Using a Direct Serial Port
Connection:” on page 49 for more information.

The goal of the remote configuration method is to allow an administrator to
provide the initial configuration settings of an appliance before the physical
installation of the system. Using the remote configuration method, an
administrator uses an HTML page to specify the initial configuration settings,
which are then embedded into a URL. To configure the appliance, a remote
installer only has to place the appliance into the network and click the generated
URL. After the appliance has its initial configuration, the administrator can finish
configuring the appliance—either remotely or locally.
The remote configuration method is useful in the following circumstances:
•

You have appliances destined for multiple locations but do not want to have
to first ship them to a single location for initial configuration.

•

The personnel at the remote locations are not technical and cannot be trusted
to properly configure the appliance.

Configuring the SG810 remotely is a two-step process—use the following
procedures if you want to enter the SG810 configuration parameters from a
remote location (Step 1), and then have an on-site administrator place the SG810
into the network and complete the configuration (Step 2).

Step One—Enter the Configuration Parameters Using a Web
Browser
Perform this procedure if you plan to enter configuration parameters for the
SG810 from a remote location and then have an on-site administrator place the
SG810 into the network and complete the configuration.

•

Selecting Allow permits any and all proxy-types access to the SG810; you
must then create policies to explicitly deny access on a case-by-case basis.

•

Selecting Deny prohibits proxy-type access to the SG810; you must then
create policies to explicitly grant access on a case-by-case basis.

For more information about this option, refer to Volume 5: Securing the
ProxySG of the Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide.

If you enter the password in plain text, click hash the password.

•

If you enter the password in hashed format, select password is in hashed
format. A hashed password must be in the BSD MD5 password format

The serial port allows you to configure and access the SG810 using a serial
cable. This can pose a security risk, because anyone with access to the
appliance can reconfigure the SG810 settings. This optional step allows you to
set a password on the serial console setup, allowing only authorized
personnel the ability to reconfigure the appliance.

WARNING! If you set the serial console password and then lose the
password, you must restore the appliance to its original factory
defaults to access the Management Console or CLI (see
“Resetting the SG810 to Factory Defaults” on page 85).

7 Click Generate URLs.
•

If a dialog appears with the message Errors Found, click OK and correct the
errors in the Initial Configuration page. Click Generate URLs again.

•

If all the fields in the form are correct, a section called Configuration
URLs appears at the bottom of the page. A list of URLs are provided in
this section—one for each of the five potential network addresses to
which the SG810 might respond. Which URL works best depends on the
network topology into which the SG810 is placed. At least one of the
URLs should work in your network environment.

8 Copy and send one or more of the URLs to the local administrator who will
be completing the configuration. Verify that the local administrator has all
required information, such as how to properly place the SG810 into the
network and, if necessary, how to modify the network parameters on his or
her PC so that the generated URL works to configure the appliance.

Step Two—Complete the Configuration
Perform the following procedure if you are at the same location as the SG810 and
you are planning to complete the initial configuration using a URL provided to
you by a remote administrator.
To Configure the SG810 Using a Remotely Generated URL:

1 Place the SG810 into your network using one of the following methods:
•

Change the IP address of the PC so that it is on one of the subnets the
appliance uses for initial configuration:
https://10.0.0.254:8083/

P/N 231-02814

https://192.168.0.254:8083/
https://192.168.1.254:8083/
•

On the PC, create a static route to the SG200. Refer to “Creating a Static
Route to the SG810” on page 83 for information about creating a static
route.

•

Deploy the SG200 inline using the bridging feature.

Refer to Volume 2: Getting Started of the Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and
Management Guide for more information about these deployments.

2 On your PC, open a Web browser using the Initial Configuration URL that
you received from the remote administrator. If the URL is a link in an e-mail,
click the link.

•

If a new browser window appears with the message ProxySG Initial
Configuration was successful, you have successfully completed initial
configuration. This window provides details about accessing the SG810
Management Console, including the Management Console SHA1
fingerprint (see Figure 2-6 on page 36). Save this information for future
reference. Close the new browser window and the Initial Configuration
page.

•

If the URL was not entered correctly or was corrupted, an error page
displays. Fix the problem indicated and click Configure Device again.

•

If the SG810 is unavailable (for example, it is not connected to the
network properly or is already configured), you either fail to connect to
the Web page (and see a browser error page), or you see a Blue Coat Web
page that describes some of the potential problems you might have. Fix

P/N 231-02814

the problem, if possible, and click Configure Device again. If you cannot fix
the problem, contact the remote administrator for assistance.

Note:

You might need to modify the network parameters on your PC so
that the URL works to configure the SG810. Consult the remote
administrator if you suspect that this is required.

When you have set the basic networking parameters and connected the SG810 to
the network, you are ready to fully configure the appliance. For a list of all CLI
commands, refer to the Blue Coat ProxySG Command Line Interface Reference. For
information about configuring and administering the SG810 (including
information about setting policies that will explicitly grant or deny proxied
transactions), refer to the Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide.

Section F: Logging on to the SG810
Once the SG810 is configured, the LCD will begin to cycle through and display
various messages, such as CPU Utilization and Freshness.
After you have completed the initial configuration and connected the SG810 to
the network, you must log on to the SG810 to fully configure the appliance. There
are two ways to do this.
•

Use a browser to access the SG810 Management Console Web interface.

•

Use a direct serial connection or an SSH Client to access the SG810
command-line interface (CLI).

Important: Blue Coat recommends that you set up a secure SSL connection
for greater security. For instructions, refer to the Volume 5:
Securing the ProxySG in the Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration
and Management Guide.

Logging on to the SG810 Management Console
The Management Console is a graphical interface for configuring and managing
all aspects of the SG810. You can log on to the Management Console using a
browser.
To Log on to the Management Console Using a Browser:

1 Start the SG810.
2 Open a browser. The SG810 supports Microsoft® Internet Explorer 6.0,
Netscape® Communicator 7.2, and Firefox 1.0.

3 Enter the IP address configured during initial configuration, followed by the
port number 8082. For example, enter: https://10.25.36.47:8082.

4 Click Yes in the Security Alert dialog; enter a username and password in the
Enter Network Password dialog that displays. If the username has not been
changed, the default is admin. The password is the one you wrote down or

Logging on to the SG810 CLI
You can connect to the SG810 CLI (a) by using a direct serial connection or (b) by
using an SSH client, such as PuTTY or F-Secure. To connect to the SG810 CLI using
Telnet, you must first enable the Telnet-Console. Refer to the “Managing Port
Services” section of the Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide.

Note:

The CLI uses two passwords: The console password is required to
establish a connection to the interface, and the enable password
can be set to restrict access to the privileged mode configuration
options. If you forget the username or password, you can reset them
using either the front panel control buttons and LCD or a serial
terminal or PC.

Using a Direct Serial Connection to Connect to the SG810 CLI

Section G: Configuring a Front-Panel PIN
The front panel allows you to reconfigure the initial settings of the SG810, which
can represent a security risk. Setting a front-panel PIN limits access to authorized
personnel only.
This procedure is only available through the CLI—you cannot set a front-panel
PIN through the Management Console.
To Configure a Front-Panel PIN:

1 Connect to the SG810 CLI and access the privileged-mode configure
commands (see “Logging on to the SG810” on page 64).

2 From the privileged mode command prompt, change the SG810 front panel
PIN by entering one of the following commands:
SGOS#(config) security front-panel-pin PIN

-orSGOS#(config) security hashed-front-panel-pin hashed_PIN

where PIN is an unhashed PIN and hashed_PIN is a PIN in hashed format.
After entering one of these commands, anyone who attempts to configure the
SG810 through the front panel will be prompted to enter the PIN.

Note:

The front-panel PIN commands are hidden commands. If you enter
the commands listed above and receive an unrecognized command
message, enter the following command and try again:

The front-panel LCD turns off after 30 seconds by default. This behavior is
configurable—you can set the LCD to remain on at all times, to turn off after a
specified length of time, or to flash (the flash setting can be helpful if you need to
find one SG810 in a room full of them).
The front-panel LCD cannot be configured through the Management
Console—you must use the CLI.
To Configure the Front-Panel LCD through the CLI:

Chapter 3: Hot-Swapping or Installing Disk Drives
This chapter describes how to remove and install disk drives.

Important: The SG810 only supports disk-drive upgrade packages obtained
from Blue Coat Systems, Inc.

•

Adding drives
An SG810 Appliance has slots for four disk drives. If your original appliance
came with less than four disk drives, upgrade options are available from Blue
Coat.
If you are upgrading your SG810 by adding (not replacing) disk drives, you
can skip to “Installing a New Disk Drive” on page 77.

•

Hot-swapping drives
Each of the disk drives (including Disk 1) can be removed and replaced
independently, without powering off the SG810.

The SG810 will boot from any disk. When you have installed or hot-swapped a
new disk drive, the SG810 recognizes it, initializes it, and starts using it
immediately.
For initial installation of disk drives into a new SG810, see “Installing the Disk
Drives” on page 12.
There are three steps to follow when you hot-swap a disk drive.

Chapter 4: Option Cards
The Blue Coat SG810 Series comes with a number of expansion slots; three option
cards are available.

Dual Gigabit Ethernet 1000B-SX (optical) Card
This card provides one gigabit of throughput to the network.

Dual Gigabit Ethernet (copper) Pass-Through Card
This card is a two-port, PCI network interface card (NIC). The Pass- Through
Card has three separate functions:
•

It works as a standard NIC to move data in and out of the SG810.

•

It provides a hardware failover mechanism in case of a power loss to or
hardware or software failure in the SG810. In the event of any of the above,
the Pass-Through card will physically bypass Ethernet traffic around the
SG810.

•

It does away with the need for a router or Layer 4 switch when the SG810 is
configured for transparent proxy by working with Layer 4 redirection
software in the SGOS operating system.

SSL Accelerator Card
This PCI card enables the SSL proxy service to intercept HTTPS traffic (in explicit
and transparent modes) so that security measures such as authentication, virus
scanning and URL filtering, and performance enhancements such as HTTP
caching can be applied to HTTPS content. Additionally, the SSL proxy allows you
to validate server certificates presented by various HTTPS sites at the gateway
and offers information about the HTTPS traffic in the access log.

The Initial Configuration Page is Not Accessible
This is a networking problem or you entered an incorrect network address.
Attempt the following:
•

Verify that the SG810 is powered on.

•

Verify that both interfaces have established a network link.

•

Verify that you entered the correct initial configuration URL:
https://proxysg.bluecoat.com:8083/.

•

Try one of the following URLs to access the Initial Configuration page:
https://10.0.0.254:8083/
https://172.16.0.254:8083/
https://192.168.0.254:8083/
https://192.168.1.254:8083/
https://204.94.89.100:8083/

To use the preceding URLs, the host client has to be in the same subnet as one
of the IP addresses. Or, you can add a static route on the host client.
•

Verify that the browser is not proxied. To change or check the browser
settings, complete one of the following steps:
•

In a Windows browser, select Tools>Internet Options>Connections. Click LAN
Settings and deselect Proxy server if it is selected.

•

In a Firefox browser, select Tools>Options>General. Click the Connection
Settings button and deselect Manual or Automatic Proxy Configuration if one
of them is selected (select Direct Connection to the Internet).

•

In a Netscape Communicator browser, select
Edit>Preferences>Advanced>Proxies and deselect Manual or Automatic Proxy
Configuration if one of them is selected (select Direct Connection to the
Internet).

•

Creating a Static Route to the SG810
I f your SG810 is running 4.2.2.x or later and you want to use the Web-based initial
configuration method, you might need to create a static route from your PC to one
of the “soft” initial configuration IP addresses.
To create a static route to the SG810

1 Access the Windows command prompt.
2 Enter the following command:
C:\>route add proxySG_ip_address mask subnet_mask client_ip_address

In the preceding command, soft_ip_address is one of the “soft” IP addresses the
SG810 listens for and client_ip_address is the address of the PC.
For example:
C:\>route add 10.0.0.254 mask 255.255.255.255 10.2.11.155

3 Verify the static route by entering the following command:
C:\>route print

You cannot access the serial console
If you have connected a serial cable to the SG810 but you cannot open the serial
console, do the following:
•

Check cable connections.

•

Check configuration information at the terminal emulator for the correct
settings (see “Initial Configuration Using a Direct Serial Port Connection” on
page 40 for information).

•

Verify that the serial cable is a Null Modem type cable. The cable pin outs can
be found at http://www.bluecoat.com/support/self-service/1/pinouts.html

•

Use a different cable.

You cannot access the Management Console
If the browser fails to connect to the SG810 successfully, complete the following
steps to identify the problem.
•

Verify that you have the correct IP address and port for the SG810 in your
Web browser (the default port is 8082).

P/N 231-02814

SG810 Installation Guide

page 83

Verify the address and port using the CLI through the Serial Console, and
display the network configuration. For information on how to do this, see
“Initial Configuration Using a Direct Serial Port Connection” on page 40.
•

Verify that the workstation is configured and working properly by connecting
to other Web sites. This test might fail if your browser is configured to use the
SG810 as a proxy server and there is a problem with the SG810.

•

If accessing an SG810 located on a remote network (any segment other than
the segment to which the workstation is attached), verify that other servers on
that network are accessible.

•

Ping the IP address to verify that the SG810 is accessible from the
workstation. If the SG810 does not respond to the ping, verify that the SG810
is operational (as described earlier).

A Security Warning Appears for the Initial
Configuration Web Page
When you open the Initial Configuration page, a security warning dialog appears.
This warning indicates that the SG810 credentials could not be verified by a
known certificate authority (such as VeriSign®). This is because the SG810
dynamically generated the self-signed credentials at the time of the last factory
reset—they are not registered with a known certificate authority.
Normally, accepting such a credential represents a security risk because of the
possibility of a man-in-the-middle attack. However, when you have connected
your PC directly to the SG810, as described in this guide, a man-in-the-middle
attack is impossible. The SG810 has not yet been configured and is connected
directly to your PC. The Initial Configuration Web page is accessible only through
an SG810 that has not yet been configured.
You can verify that the serial number in the credential matches the serial number
printed on the SG810 if you want to be absolutely certain that you have connected
to the correct device.

The SG810 certificate is no longer valid
If you move the SG810 from its original location or change the IP address for any
reason, the SG810’s security certificate might not be accepted the next time you
open the Management Console.

P/N 231-02814

SG810 Installation Guide

page 84

This is because the hostname no longer matches the hostname on the certificate.
You must create a new certificate and then edit the HTTPS-Console service to use
it.
For information about creating a new certificate and editing the HTTPS-Console
service, refer to Volume 5: Securing the ProxySG of the Blue Coat ProxySG
Configuration and Management Guide.

Resetting the SG810 to Factory Defaults
When the SG810 is powered on and has booted up, but an initial configuration
has not yet been performed, the Power LED flashes green and amber. If the Power
LED is solid green, the initial configuration has already been performed. If you
did not perform an initial configuration, but the Power LED is solid green, reset
the appliance to its factory defaults. Also reset the appliance if you cannot connect
to the Initial Configuration page through your browser. The initial configuration
Web page is accessible only to an appliance that has not been configured.
You can reset the SG810 to factory defaults using the Management Console or the
CLI.
To reset the SG810 to Factory Defaults

1 Access the SG810 Management Console.
