Easy to deploy as fixed or portable/rnobile units
The Node is housed in a rugged, compact lightweight
enclosure and has an environmental cover that provides IP67
protection for hostile environments. It is low power and can be
powered from multiple sources. It can be discreetly deployed
in-building, easily mast mounted outdoors or deployed in
various man-portable or mobile configurations. Data can be
accessed securely in real time via IF! stored locally to USB
drive or optional internal SSD, transmitted via the built-in
modem or via Ethernet to a centralized database.

Intelligent networkable node for spectrum
monitoring of sensitive buildings, critical sites,
borders, or any area of interest
The RFeye Node sets the new standard for high performance, cost-

* Embedded Linux system, local bulk data
storage, integrated SSD option
Rugged and compact, /P67 with optional

effective, real time 2417 monitoring of the radio spectrum. It has been
designed and packaged to enable flexible and scalable deployments
in remote distributed networks.With built-in intelligence, the Node can
operate both autonomously and in cooperation with other Nodes in the
network.

Very high probability of signal intercept
Capable of sweeping from 10 MHz to 6 GHz (or optionally to 18 GHz) at
40 GHzls, the RFeye Node captures signals of all types, including transient
transmissions such as pulsing or short-burst signals. High sensitivity and
exceptionally low spurious components mean that it is able reliably to
distinguish even very low power signals from the noise floor.

Flexible multi-user multi-mission capability
The RFeye's unique architecture is capable of supporting multiple
concurrent tasks and missions, as well as multiple queries from
simultaneous users. Remote programming allows tasks to be assigned
relative priorities and the Node is able seamlessly to execute the
required tasks in the most efficient manner. In this way, the Node is
able concurrently to perform sweeps and IQ captures, make spectrum
occupancy measurements, monitor mask breakages and trigger alarms,
log data to memory, record sequences for playback, measure an AOA
bearing or coordinate with nearby Nodes to carry out geolocation
measurements usingTDOA or POA techniques. In addition, there is no limit
to the number of users who can simultaneously query the Node via IP and
make varying requests to display information of interest.
