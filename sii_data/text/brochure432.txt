offers some assistance with structured data, but

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

the absence of grammatical and contextual clues
poses a particular challenge.

Mac OS X, Windows XP or later, or Linux with X-Windows
Java Runtime Environment 1.6.0 update 10 or later

Introducing Virtus Translator

Minimum recommended processor speed of lGHz

Virtus Translator was designed specifically t o

Minimum recommended 1GB of RAM

translate structured data. For each column

2.5GB of available disk space (at least 4GB of disk space
prior to the installation process)

of a dataset, Virtus automatically identifies
the language and category and recommends
a translation strategy, while giving complete
control t o the user t o make any changes. Patentpending algorithms allow Virtus t o translate
structured data accurately and rapidly.
Virtus was designed and engineered b y
experienced computational linguists with deep
expertise in the challenges associated with
translating structured data.
