Agenda
! Convergence of Fixed and Mobile services are driving networks
towards IMS based architectures in order to offer ubiquitous
services.
! This session looks at:
! How networks are evolving to deliver new services.
! The requirements placed on the networks to deliver LI
! A brief overview of a typical VoIP LI architecture
! Pulling it all together

Next Generation Networks - Observations
! Tier 2s lead the way with tactical IMS deployments
! Tier 1s generally playing catch up
! Most VoIP plays are opportunistic/tactical today
! NGN is more than VoIP
! Consumer, Business and Enterprise focus
! Many different forms of NGN
! PSTN replacement – 21CN
! New service overlay – PoC
! Multimedia – Video services
! Fixed Mobile Convergence
! IPTV

! All of this means network evolution and IMS

3

Why IMS?
! PSTN -> IMS is a logical migration step to provide new services
! PSTNs which have already migrated to NGNs may look at reducing
further CAPEX by migrating to an IMS-like core
! IMS provides the glue between services and networks
! It aims to deliver any service to any device over any network
! Designed to allow rapid prototyping and deployment of services
! Mobile Service Providers:
! IMS was created to fulfil need for ‘feature rich’ services
! Converged service to business and residential

! Wireline Service Providers:
! Long term PSTN replacement programs
! Must innovate to regenerate Wireline revenues
! Add value to existing services
! Move into new markets via convergence
! Reduce Opex

The Evolution Path
! Today VoIP is driving deployments
! Often overlaid onto current IP data networks
! All I need is a Softswitch?
! Need to overcome some issues to achieve this
! Connectivity
! Quality
! Security
! Resilience

Summary of LI landscape
! Separate legal frameworks for most countries
! Technical standards mostly relate to interfaces – with much
common ground
! But most have some common requirements
! Legally sanctioned official access to private communications
! Can only be enabled with a legal warrant
! Required functionality in modern telecoms equipment
! Must provide transparent interception of specified traffic only
! Targeted user must not be aware of interception
! Other users must not be affected during interception

12

Getting Access to Signalling and Media
! Intercept model
assumes
communications
nodes can access
signalling and media
! In VoIP Networks
they are separated –
often in different
devices
! Session control
devices are already
aware of signalling
media relationships

(Media)

NB – in VoIP networks the Media and Signalling can take different paths
NB – Anti-tomboning may mean the media is not even in the same
network as signalling

PacketCable™ Architecture Conceptual

! PacketCable™ surveillance model - CALEA compliant
! The same basic arrangements as ETSI
15

ETSI Architecture Conceptual

! General Networks architecture for Intercept (ETSI)

16

LI Elements – Administration Function

! The Network Operator implements interception warrants via the
Administration Function
! The Administration Function manages the Intercept Function in
the network nodes and the Media Functions
17

LI Elements – Handover Interfaces

! Three Handover Interfaces link the Public and LEA networks
! HI1 – Administration input
! HI2 – IRI delivery to Law Enforcement Monitoring Facility (LEMF)
! HI3 – CC delivery to LEMF
18

LI Elements – Interception Function

! Internal Intercept Functions (IIF) implemented in network nodes
! Warrant may require IRI, CC or both
19

LI Elements – Mediation Function

! Mediation Functions convert deliver Intercept Information to the
LEMF over standard interfaces, HI2, and HI3
! Delivery may be IRI, CC or both
20

Architecture - Physical
! Intercept Functions
present on both signalling
(IRI) and media (CC)
elements
! Management Unit runs the
Administration Function,
performs provisioning and
monitoring.
! Handover Unit runs the
Mediation Function,
performs buffering,
validation and countryspecific delivery.
! Both units backed up by
warm standbys with
automatic replication of
data between peers.

Conclusion
! Networks will continue to evolve to support Multimedia services
! Separated signalling and multiple media paths will become
prevalent
! Distributed (edge) elements – Gateways and Controllers are
strategically located to facilitate target acquisition
! A flexible approach is essential to allow natural network
evolution whilst still meeting both commercial and regulatory
needs
