Marlin Portable Monitoring Unit
Overview
Marlin is a rapidly deployable system for the monitoring of calls made across the Inmarsat and
Thuraya satellite systems. The call intercept is invisible to both the user and the satellite
network.
Marlin enables traffic between the
mobile terminal and the satellite to
be monitored in a line of sight
operation, within radio range of the
target.
Control of the system is via an
intuitive windows based GUI.
Incoming calls are displayed in realtime, and voice is played via a laptop
computer, with each side of the call
played back on either channel of the
stereo output. Software to decode
and display a number of fax and data
protocols is included with the GUI.
Information relating to the identification of called and calling parties is recorded, along with the
geographical location (depending on service type and network).

Physical Description
The Marlin Portable Monitoring System comprises:
• Laptop
• Satellite and Target Antennae
• Marlin Portable Monitoring Unit
• Power Supply
These are supplied in travel cases for easy transport.
The monitoring unit itself is housed in a small desktop case (a rack mountable version is also
available).
It contains the following removable cards:
• 2 x Multi-channel Demodulator Cards
• 1 x Dual L-band Down Converter
Each card sits horizontally and plugs into the unit from the front, allowing easy replacement of
individual cards. A backplane provides power and signal distribution within the unit, along with
accommodating an Ethernet Switch and Frequency Reference.

Technical Description
The Demodulator Card includes the following:
• Wideband High Speed ADC
• Digital Down-Converter
• Digital Signal Processor
• Ethernet Interface
The Demodulator Card accepts an instantaneous bandwidth of 34MHz, centered around
72MHz. The signal is filtered for image rejection, and then digitized by a high-speed analog-todigital converter. Frequency-tuning is performed by a digital down converter (DDC). The
resultant base-band signals are filtered by a programmable digital filter and DMA’d directly to
the DSP for demodulation. The demodulated data is output via the Ethernet Interface.
The Dual Down Converter Card takes L-band input from the Satellite and Target antennas, and
down-converts to the 72MHz required by the demodulator cards. Power is supplied to the
antenna LNAs via the same connection, allowing rapid deployment. It features variable
attenuation to accommodate the wide range of signal conditions experienced in the tactical
environment.
The backplane provides a 10 MHz reference and IF input signal to each of the Demodulator
Cards. The 10MHz frequency reference is derived from a temperature compensated crystal
oscillator with a stability of 1ppm.
The Ethernet Switch provides 4 10/100BaseT auto-negotiating Ethernet ports. Two of the ports
connect internally to the Demodulator Cards. The remaining two ports are connected to RJ-45
connectors on the front of the unit. One allows connection to the laptop required for control of
the Marlin. The other is an expansion port. This allows a second unit to be ‘daisy chained’, so
that both units may be controlled from a single laptop, or for the connection of compatible
accessories.
