Devices) and lEDs (Improvised Explosive Devices) are
the weapon of choice used by terrorists in conflict
zones. Homemade lEDs and roadside bombs are
remotely activated by transmitting an RF signal, via a

remote transmitter, to a miw attached to the bomb
or improvised explosive device. Stratign's RCIED
Jammers are designed to neutralize the detonation of
the explosive by interfering with the radio transmission
that the bomber initiates to trigger the bomb. It does
this by radiating a jamming signal that obliterate the

The term communications jamming (COMJAM) is
electronic jamming that is directed against
communications circuits and systems. COMJAM is
used to prevent radio communications by the use of
electromagnetic signals, i.e., the deliberate radiation,
re-radiation, or reflection of electromagnetic energy
with the objective of impairing the effective use of
electronic communication systems. The aim of
communications
jamming
is
to
prevent
communications by electromagnetic means, or at least
to degrade communication sufficiently to cause delays
in transmission and reception.
Stratign offers various configurations of RClED
Jammers to suite various operational requirements of
the customers.

Radio Jammers
Stratign's Communication Jammers are intended to
create active barrage jamming in tactical units of the

Cell Phone Jammers

Stratign's Cell Phone Jammer's have been designed to
provide the blocking of various means of cellular
communications in any area where they frequently
cause nuisance either by loud incoming call rings or
loud telephone conversations or to block the
communication in the secured area. Phone Jammer is
suitable in Prisons, Executive offices, Board Meeting

Stratign's GPS Jammers are used for area protection
against satellite navigated hostile threats. It will
effectively protect a well defined area from ground and
sky threats while it will not, in any way, affect normal
operation of navigation services outside this area. It is
designed to operate for all Satellite Navigation
Systems available today or in the near future, including
GPS, GPS Ill, GALILEO and GLONASS. It is
upgradableto operate for COMPASS.
The system's base configuration covers the standard
GPS bands L1 (codes P(Y), CIA, LAC, M-code) and L2
(codes PM, CIA, LlC, M-code) while versatile options
allow the system to be configured for GPS Ill, GALILEO
and GLONASS.

radio reception in a designated a&. The FM Jammer
is a power full jamming system, designed specifically
for military/police deployment at large public
gatherings, riots, marches, anti-government protests,
rallies, etc. to jam the FM radio reception. The Jammer
is designed to effectively jam FM radio reception within
a large designated area where jammer is deployed.
Based on advanced jamming technology, the system
transmits RF signal which block the communication
between the FM broadcasting station and FM receiver,
actively jamming FM frequencies.
The Jammer is available in the Frequency range of
88-108 MHz in bands with a Transmit output power d
88-108 MHz 1000 Watts.

Stratign's C & KU band Satellite Jammer is a latest
development in response to various requirements from
customers who are interested in deploying jamming
systems and sub-systems to fight terrorism and illegal
usage of Satellite Spectrum technology. The system is
an integrated platform, which can be deployed on
Land (Vehicle,. Shelters, Telecom Towers etc.") Air
(Aerostats1Balloons) or in sea (Cargo Vessels 1Boats).
The basic objective of the system is to conduct
jamming on DOWNLINK Signals of a particular
frequency of Interest. These frequencies can be on a
TV channel or even of a particular VSAT network. The
system caters to VSAT terminals operating in C or KU
band and is designed on customer specific
requirements. The Static Variant currently enables the
customer to jam KU Band andlor C Band VSATI TVRO
Reception communications in the area of 20 X 20 kms.
To jam a bigger area, multiple systems can be used
simultaneously.

Briefcase1 Man-pack Installed RClED
Jammers
Briefcase RClED Jammer is a Portable Bomb Jammer
built into a briefcase, designed to defend against
radio-controlled improvised explosive devices. The
Jammer is designed to be operated as portable system
movable from car to home, office, operational field etc.
In case of portable operation, the Jammer is powered
by

an

internal

rechargeable battery

with

an

autonomous operation capability of upto 1 hour. In
?ase of vehicular operation the Jammer is powered by
a special supply that can be supplied optionally.
The Man-Pack jammer is a lightweight portable system

used to protect military, law enforcement and EOD
personnel in areas which could harbour potential
radio-detonated IED threats. It is used for jamming
RCIED's to protect people or vehicle on the move
either during a column march or during an individual
vehicle movement. The equipment is especially useful
to protect against radio controlled land mines.
Based on the customers' requirement the Jammer can
be factory configured to operate in a frequency band of
20 MHz - 2 GHz. The power output of the Jammer can
also be factory configured from 50W upto 250W.
