Ruggedized MPM-1000 IP Modem
Provides Military and Commercial Customers with the
Specialized IP SATCOM Necessary to Keep Highly Mobile,
Dispersed and Remote Users Connected
Linkabit’s Ruggedized MPM-1000 Modem IP (RMPM) with its Network Centric
Waveform (NCW) reduces operational cost and supports the highest number of
IP users by providing very efficient use of Satellite Bandwidth over any
Military or Commercial transponded satellite. The RMPM is a conduction
cooled unit that is environmentally sealed for optimal use in harsh environments. It has been tested and certified to meet all the requirements of the tactical
environment. The RMPM is fully automated and once properly configured,
requires no operator intervention if link conditions change, or if a different
type terminal joins the network. It has been designed to utilize and optimize the
full capabilities of the Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) multi-beam, multiband satellite.
The NCW is the U.S. Army’s Open Standard (Non-Proprietary) Waveform that
provides optimal performance in any SATCOM architecture with any size
aperture terminal. It provides a fully certified secure network that is self forming
and self healing making it very easy to use and maintain. Satellite resources can
be managed on the battlefield or remote area with no special hub hardware
required. Any large aperture terminal can operate as the Network Controller
and there are allowances for automatic or planned Network Control handover.
With its rapid acquisition/reacquisition, hub assist functions and Doppler
compensation, it provides outstanding support for COTM communications.
