TRM-1000
SATCOM On-The-Move Terminal
Continuous and reliable access to real time information is a key
enabler to keep remote users connected where infrastructure is
lacking (e.g. natural disasters, border surveillance and tactical
scenarios).
The TRM-1000 is a field-proven, highly efficient, flexible, secure,
low cost, SATCOM On-the-Move (SOTM) terminal that provides
users the specialized IP SATCOM that is necessary to keep mobile
and dispersed troops connected.
The major components of the TRM-1000 are the MPM-1000
Internet Protocol (IP) modem with its embedded Network Centric
Waveform (NCW), plus a FSS-4000 series On-the-Move (OTM) antenna.
The TRM-1000 is specifically designed to utilize the full capabilities
of the Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) satellites. The NCW is
designed to support the IP user by using native Ethernet encapsulation,
which makes it easy to configure military networks that require
COMSEC, TCP accelerators, and any other IP net-working devices.

The TRM-1000 features an affordable and flexible Vehicular
Mounted Earth Station (VMES) antenna, configurable for most
platforms and missions. With their multi-aperture and multi-band
capability on a common pedestal, the antennas offer greater
deployment flexibility.

– F ULL - MOTION AZIMUTH OVER ELEVATION

Connection and configuration of the TRM-1000 is very simple. An
external power connection is all that is required.
Once the components are mounted, an intuitive
user interface allows
for quick configuration
and monitoring.
