iLink Agg
(16) 10/100/1000/Gig Network Ports to
(8) 10/100/1000/Gig Monitor Ports
Fully Configurable Port Mapping
With 24 ports in a 1U form-factor, Net Optics iLink Agg is the industry’s highest port density
1 Gigabit link aggregator designed for monitoring applications. It enables a pool of
monitoring tools to be applied to as many as 8 network links (using integrated in-line Taps)
or 16 Span ports, with fully configurable port mapping. Aggregate traffic from some ports.
Regenerate monitor streams to multiple ports. Switch links to tools in a 1-to-1 mapping. The
Link Agg supports any configuration—monitor ports can also be used as additional network
ports, and Span network ports can be used as additional monitor ports. You can even split a
cable and use the RX fiber for a network connection and the TX fiber for a monitor
connection, increasing the potential number of ports to 24 network plus 24 monitor.
The iLink Agg Span model has 24 SFP ports that enable mixing fiber and copper
transceivers to match any links, Span ports, and tools. In-line models are available
supporting singlemode and multimode fiber as well as copper media on the network side,
and SFP ports to support any interface on monitoring tools. When required, data rate
conversion between network ports and monitor ports is automatic.
Manage the iLink Agg locally or remotely. Management features include simple port
mapping, SSH security, role-based access, RADIUS and TACACS+ authentication and
authorization, RMON traffic statistics, and remote software upgrades.

Performance:

All of the integrated copper and fiber Taps in the iLink Agg in-line models are fully passive,
keeping traffic flowing even when the device is not powered. For additional reliability, the
iLink Agg features hot-swappable redundant power supplies.

No packets are dropped when the aggregated traffic to any monitor
port does not exceed the monitor port bandwidth

Passive, Secure Technology

CLI local or SSH remote, RADIUS, TACACS+, RMON

• Increases monitoring efficiency by enabling tools to view the traffic on as many as eight
network links (inline models) or 16 Span ports or external Taps (Span model) simultaneously
• Eliminates resource contention by enabling as many as eight devices to monitor identical
traffic at the same time
• Improves monitoring flexibility with fully configurable port mappings (any number of
links to any number of tools)
• Provides complete visibility at 1 Gbps without interfering with the data stream and
without introducing a point of failure
• Supports media type conversion with SFP transceiver modules on the monitor ports (all
models) and the network ports (Span model only)
• Enhances monitoring security because no IP address is needed
