		 Intelligence Platform
Trace the track … to stay ahead

The black panther is characterized by its
remarkable elegance of movement and
outstanding intelligence. Its position at the
top of the food chain is undisputed. Its nose
is so sensitive that it can trace even the
faintest track. That is why we have chosen
the panther’s nose as the symbol for our
Intelligence Platform.

Today, the greatest challenge which law
enforcement agencies have to face worldwide
is not data collection, but data analysis. It is not
a matter of obtaining and accessing authentic
data, but of putting information in context and
transforming it into intelligence.
Intelligence is the synergetic product of connecting
the dots and providing meaningful and trustworthy
information to decision-makers about the
changing nature of threats.
Our Intelligence Platform is a comprehensive and
flexible intelligence analysis solution. It dissects
huge amounts of data and finds hidden clues in
seemingly meaningless snippets of information.
It creates new intelligence by using sophisticated
intelligence applications and extensive automation
to process mass data.
The basic principle of the Intelligence Platform
is very simple: It offers one platform and one
desktop for all functions. However, the modular,
scalable design allows for a high degree of
customization by which all features can be
configured to meet customer requirements.
Optional intelligence modules can be added
separately on request.



The Intelligence Platform provides intelligence
which results from the collection, processing,
integration, analysis, evaluation and correlation
of available data, thereby supporting the entire
intelligence cycle.
It is the smart analytical tool for intelligence
personnel and analysts, enabling them to trace
the track and helping decision-makers to fulfill
their mandates: To identify and predict trends,
patterns or problem areas that require action.
Its outstanding features enable them to react on
a level totally unmatched in today’s and
tomorrow’s world of preemptive security.
The Nokia Siemens Networks Intelligence
Platform sets new standards in intelligence.
It offers innovative tailored solutions which are
characterized by operational agility independent
of time and place. It has been designed to meet all
law-enforcement and governmental requirements
and standards – to trace the track and stay ahead.

Our Vision
With insight and ingenuity we will continue
to break new ground and lead the way for
innovative intelligence solutions. We are
convinced that our expertise will enhance
peace and thereby contribute to the
quality of peoples’ lives.
Our Commitment
We deliver evolutionary security solutions
by combining best-of-class products,
state-of-the-art technologies, services
and creativity, thus generating sustainable
customer benefits.
Our Core Values
We are guided by customer-centered
principles. These are based on mutual
trust, reliability and stability.
Our Credo
It is idle merely to philosophize about
warnings like “Without security, there is
no freedom”. Good governance acts upon
them and takes appropriate measures
to make the world a safer place for
individuals, families and nations.

We believe that this is where true
freedom begins.
Our Mission
We are making the world safer with
trendsetting intelligence solutions.

We are pioneers, constantly pushing boundaries to break
new ground for innovative solutions.
We are passionate, employing all our talent and energy to help our customers
fulfill their mandates.
	
We are pragmatic, determined to make sure that our solutions always

	Never before has information been exchanged so rapidly and in so many ways.
Needless to say, criminals and terrorist organizations have also been quick to
realize the vast opportunities presented by modern telecommunications.
	
	
When it comes to fighting crime and thwarting terrorist attacks,
law enforcement and government security agencies need the right
communication tools to get results.
This is why state-of-the-art systems are an absolute ‘must’ in monitoring the
communications of specific groups or individuals, for example in preventing criminal
activities or collecting hard and fast evidence.



Network operators around the

	 Equipping network operators
for all eventualities ...

Is it sufficient to install special
equipment as the need arises?
There are many benefits with Nokia
Siemens Networks LI solutions
integrated in standard network
equipment. The beauty of these is
that they
• come from a single source
• do not require any additional
space or camouflage
• are ready for operation at all times
• fulfill the most stringent of legal
requirements
• do not interfere with regular
network operations in any way
• function reliably, securely and
discreetly on the basis of globally
proven network technology
• permit centralized operation
and system maintenance/
troubleshooting



Do you need high-security areas
and specially trained staff for all
switches?
This is no longer necessary if
you use our efficient Interception
Management System (IMS). With
low space and cost requirements,
IMS offers location as well as
organization-independent and thus
highly flexible administration of lawful
interception. Even in its smallest
configuration, it can handle
• central administration of more
than 1,000 lawful interceptions at
any one time in different networks
• integration of system users
located far from the central IMS
server or external users working
with LI applications from other
vendors

	As a telecom carrier you probably already know that you are obliged to perform
lawful interception in all your networks and for all the telecommunications
services you offer. This means you need to have the equipment required by
law and be prepared to act rapidly, if need be. After all, your operating license
depends on it.
Understandably, however, you also want to minimize the resources deployed in lawful
interception and prevent this from interfering with your core business. So, how can you
make sure you are always prepared – in terms of both staff and technology – while
remaining within your budget?
What about the need to invest
in new solutions each time the
requirements have changed?
Choose a system that can evolve
over time and thus meet all your
future needs. The network-end
LI solutions from Nokia Siemens
Networks can be
• scaled in size
• configured separately in terms of
capacity
• adapted to comply with different
legal requirements
• expanded if necessary to
accommodate new standards and
interfaces

Are there any additional
precautions to protect the system
and network from unauthorized
access?

Or perhaps would you rather
avoid all the hassle?

Security is already an integral
component. LI solutions from Nokia
Siemens Networks

With a service mandate you can
delegate the entire area of lawful
interception to our security-cleared
LI experts. These are well versed in
all the relevant technical and legal
issues on an international level.

• are based on standard network
equipment, and thus not even
detectable by experts
• function completely independently
of regular network operations
• are operated centrally via a
management system with a
security-oriented user concept
and sophisticated access
protection
• additionally protect the network
elements against unauthorized
access through a special
authentication process

Then let us do the work.

Please have a look at page 23 for
more on our comprehensive service
offer.

	 Answering the transformation
of the telecom landscape ...

Is a complete data inflow from all
networks guaranteed?

Can you decide which target-data
needs to be intercepted?

You can be sure of this, if the
network uses LI solutions by Nokia
Siemens Networks. Collecting
data from fixed and mobile public
networks, Next Generation Networks
and the internet provides you with

You should only receive the data
you really need. With this in mind
the Nokia Siemens Networks LI
solutions offer the following data
delivery options

• Intercept Related Information
(IRI), i.e. details on any successful
or unsuccessful target activity
- for example every telephone
call that is diverted, any
changes made on the
subscriber line (such as feature
activation and deactivation) or,
in case of mobile networks, the
subscriber’s current location
• call content, i.e. the complete
content of all voice, fax and data
transmissions from or to the target
• notification of all LI-relevant
incidents (e.g. setting up or
activation/deactivation of lawful
interception in the network)
* See page 12 for a list of targets that can be
monitored using Nokia Siemens Network end-toend solutions.



• separate delivery of call content
and IRI
• joint delivery of call content and
IRI (always the case for internet
data transfers, otherwise optional)
• delivery of IRI only (converted
on request into e.g. ETSI or text
format)
• delivery to up to five LEAs
(defining for each recipient either
IRI only or both, IRI and call
content)

	Recent changes in legislation will place an even greater burden on you in the
future. Meanwhile, new technologies and the ever-expanding range of networkindependent services are transforming the telecommunications landscape into
a virtual jungle, with a labyrinth of intertwining paths which makes it increasingly
difficult for you to follow leads. Your job is getting more and more complex.
What you really need to do now – perhaps together with the responsible network operators
– is to cast a critical eye over both the end-to-end systems used for collecting and
transfering information and your own equipment which receives and analyzes the data.
Is it possible to monitor all types
and sizes of data transfer?

Is data interpretation sufficiently
quick?

Can the system easily be
adapted?

Definitely, if you use the Nokia
Siemens Networks Monitoring
Center at your agency. This versatile
system

Our Monitoring Center helps to speed
up your investigative work as it

No matter which new technical or
organizational requirements come
into effect, the modular Nokia
Siemens Networks Monitoring
Center keeps you flexible and up-todate at all times, as it

• ‘understands’ all forms of voice,
fax and data communication from
all fixed and mobile networks
based on components from
leading vendors as well as Next
Generation Networks (NGN) and
the internet
• is designed as standard to
process call content and IRI sent
separately
• can also handle huge volumes of
information (e.g. from the internet)
– with no loss of quality or data –
thanks to its highly efficient
recording systems (e.g. with full
duplex/high-speed mode, voice
compression)

• automatically saves the data
received from the networks in
case-specific folders, ruling out
any confusion
• permits authorized individuals
to quickly access the specific
information needed
• facilitates and accelerates the
monitoring/surveillance process
and data analysis with a range of
user-friendly, practical features
• offers new and efficient ways of
pursuing leads (e.g. geographic
information system)

• is continually enhanced, in parallel
with the evolution of network
technologies
• can be extended or modified at
any time on the basis of existing
hardware/software components
• grows in terms of size and
capacity in accordance with your
needs
• can be configured in line with
current requirements and adapted
to comply with different legislation

	 IMS – the secure manager
		 for all networks

Universal
IMS is an interception management
system for secure, reliable and
verifiable central control of all
LI-related tasks required at the
network end: From setting up,
starting, modifying and ending the
LI instance in the network element
to the administration of user-rights
and auditing as well as alarmhandling and system maintenance/
troubleshooting. It is also used for
mediation and distribution of IRI
(Intercept Related Information,
please see page 14) and for setting
different filters in the data collectors
used for internet surveillance.

However, it can be used for vendorindependent central administration
of lawful interception in all ETSIcompliant public networks: Fixed,
mobile, and on the internet.

As part of the Nokia Siemens
Networks ‘Lawful Interception
and Monitoring concept’, the IMS
combined with the LI components
and the Monitoring Center produces
a comprehensive solution for all
network and LEA requirements.

It can be used alone, in conjunction
with other LI management systems,
or even as an umbrella system.

Monitoring

	An interception order has been issued. The instructions are clear. Now they need
to be translated into machine language and communicated to the network.
How can this be done in a fast, economical and accurate manner? How to prevent any
inadvertent or willful manipulation of the network element during the input procedure?
Who checks that everything has been done properly? And what about discretion and data
protection? – The answer is the Interception Management System (IMS).

Flexible

Region-independent

With IMS, tailor-made solutions can
easily be created for a wide variety
of circumstances
• with its client/server architecture,
the system can be scaled to
match any network size without
compromising performance
• the range of offered functions
also grows with the need and
with special, optional featurepackages on the customer’s
request
• a special IMS function is available
to assist in upgrading Nokia
Siemens Networks network
elements

Medi­a­tion
Device

Depending on whether it is for standalone operation or in conjunction
with other LI-operating systems, the
individually configurable IMS can
be used either for all LI tasks (full
mode), for LI administration only
(admin-mode) or for routing the IRI
only (ticket-mode). This ensures a
broad range of application variants
for the system.

IMS can be operated from user
stations. These can be either
centrally or remotely located.
Remote access can be secured
using VPNs. The IMS is further
supported by the external operator
interface. This also ensures IMS
access to system-users operators,
administrators, supervisors) working
with an LI application by another
vendor.

		 IMS – the secure manager
	 for all technologies and networks

Secure

Alert

Protected in a high-security area
or by a firewall, IMS is operated
completely separately from regular
network management. The
functions performed by IMS (e.g.
setting up, modifying and ending
lawful interception in the network
or converting and distributing
IRI) cannot be performed by a
conventional network management
system. Likewise, the IMS
interception manager does not
perform any standard network
management functions.

As a LEA you can also protect
yourself from sabotage or third-party
monitoring by organizing yourself as
a CUG (Closed User Group) in IMS.
All activity in or via IMS, whether
successful or not, to/from the
network or to/from your Monitoring
Center, is automatically logged and
stored, allowing it to be checked at
any time. Only the supervisor has
access to this database.

IMS provides complete system
and data protection by means of
a hierarchically structured user
concept. The GUI, strictly adapted
to each specific task area, prevents
users from exceeding their authority.
No user of the system can access
the content of the IRI transported via
IMS to its authorized destination. An
optional variety of system access
blocks all unauthorized individuals
(e.g. login with a chip card,
sophisticated password system).
In addition, the LI-fixed network
solutions include a special
authentication procedure
for additional security. This
automatically comes into play in
each dialog between IMS and
the network element, optimally
protecting the latter from sabotage.

10

Any attempt at external manipulation
is immediately detected by
a special IMS function. In all
cases of unexpected or irregular
incidents (such as network
element or transmission failures),
a sophisticated alarm system
ensures that the relevant person is
immediately notified (by a pop-up
window, email, or SMS).

Our comprehensive security
concept, which, as a rule,
also incorporates https-based
communication between IMS clients
and the IMS server, redundant
servers and interfaces as a rule,
as well as an uninterruptible power
supply, guarantees the best possible
protection against unauthorized
access and loss of data. This is also
true when the system is operated
from remote or external user
stations.
High-performance browsers, for
example, help the IMS Supervisor
fulfill his control function. One of
these is the log browser which
makes it easier for him to keep an
overview of the various procedures
processed via IMS...

	

IMS prevents users from exceeding their authorization through user-specific
menus, strictly tailored for the specific authorizations of operators, administrators
and supervisors. A range of efficient and practical features simplify and speed up
the execution of all the LI-related tasks to be performed on the network side.

Important for law enforcement
agencies...
Intercept Related Information (IRI)
which cannot be forwarded to you
straight away is never lost. It can
subsequently be retrieved via IMS
only and, on your request, also be
manually made available for you as a
file on a removable storage medium.

Economical
The centralized interception provided
by IMS, independent of both
location and organization, results
in substantial savings for you, the
network operator, in terms of both
space and staff.

A single IMS is enough to manage
several thousand lawful interceptions
running concurrently in various
networks. Its Windows-based,
user-friendly interface (see example
below) and a maximum of automatic
procedures minimize IMS inputerrors, and simplify and speed up all
steps involved.

would like to see listed in the log browser

Lawful Interception
		 and how it works ...
The Nokia Siemens Networks end-to-end LI
solutions can be used to monitor the following
targets

in fixed networks and Next
Generation Networks
• a
 ll types of subscriber access
- analog subscriber access
- ISDN-BA and ISDN-PA
- coin- or card-operated payphones
- directory-number-based calls in IP networks
- PBX directory numbers (if included in the
signaling)
- individual MSNs (multiple subscriber numbers)
of an ISDN basic access
• switch-internal subscriber numbers
• FDNs (foreign directory numbers, i.e. switchexternal directory numbers, such as in case of
calls from or to extensions or directory numbers
in transit traffic)
• nailed-up connections (dedicated lines)
• calls with call diversion
• conference calls (a special LI function
combines the call content in this case)

in mobile networks
In addition to the targets of fixed networks and
Next Generation Networks

What are your main expectations of an
end-to-end lawful interception solution?
As a network operator you want to be able to
comply with the legal requirements at minimum
cost and prevent any adverse effects on your core
business.
As a law enforcement agency you want to be able
to monitor a complete spectrum of targets, receiving
only the relevant data from the network – as required
by your organization.
The LI solutions as a part of our ‘Lawful Interception
and Monitoring concept’, designed for deployment in
various different networks, address the needs of both
sides.

No need for camouflage. No extra space
required. No interference with regular network
operation: For the network operator, LI
solutions integrated into standard network
equipment are the most discreet, secure and
cost-effective means of performing lawful
interception in fixed and mobile networks
from Nokia Siemens Networks. For you, the
law enforcement agency, these solutions
guarantee a complete, needs-oriented and
confidential data inflow from all networks.

• all types of mobile phones
• circuit-switched traffic in GPRS and 3G
networks
• packet-switched traffic in GPRS and 3G
networks

on the internet
• internet traffic at access points in the following
areas
- local loop / access provider
- service provider
- backbone

DLU / IMS

... in fixed and mobile networks ...
Verifiable
The lawful interception has been
set up using IMS. Its starting and
ending times have been defined.
The subscriber line in question
has already been marked for
interception. At the defined time,
IMS activates the interception in
the network element. Once this has
been done, LI begins to operate for
the entire monitoring period.

Whenever a call becomes active
on the line under surveillance, the
call content (i.e. the entire content
of incoming and outgoing phone
calls, fax or data transmissions) is
automatically intercepted and copied
to a monitoring connection, which is
established to the authorized LEA
only for the duration of the current
interception procedure.

Should any interruption or irregularity
occur during this automatic
procedure, the IMS operator in
charge is immediately notified by
email, SMS or a pop-up window.
Using the messages on the IMS
screen, the operator can check at
any time whether data collection is
running smoothly in the network.

Discreet

Comprehensive

LEA-friendly

The establishment of a monitoring
connection, the interception and
recording of the data on the basis
of standard network equipment is
invisible to the target-subscriber.
The process does not interfere with
regular network operation in any
way.

Moreover, apart from the
complete and discreet recording
of call content, the Nokia Siemens
Networks LI solutions also perform
another important function: As soon
as there is an activity (whether
successful or not) on the monitored
access, they also generate intercept
related information (IRI). This may
include information on the date
and time of the call, the directory
number of the other party, the call
direction (incoming or outgoing), any
call diversion procedures invoked,
and (optional in mobile networks)
the current location of the target
subscriber. They also provide
information on any technical or
administrative changes made on
the marked access (e.g. feature
activation or deactivation).

• you can decide in each case
whether you need only the IRI
(which often includes sufficient
information in itself) or also the
call content, thereby minimizing
the data inflow, and thus also the
time you need to evaluate it
• you can be assured that even
if you do not receive any call
content (for technical or other
reasons), you will nevertheless
have the IRI which – as already
explained on page 11 – cannot
get lost, even in the case of
delivery problems

As the subscriber is not aware of
the interception process, even if
it starts after a call has become
active, there is no risk that he may
hear suspicious tapping noises and
therefore perhaps cut short the call.
Its recorded content is sent to the
LEA’s equipment directly from the
switch. This is the reason why it
cannot be intercepted or accessed at
the IMS or manipulated in any way.

Regardless of the call content, an
IRI is first sent to IMS. From here
it is forwarded via a data network
(public X.25, ISDN or IP network)
to the monitoring equipment of the
LEA. Based on the unambiguosly
assigned ID criteria, the IRI is
automatically correlated with the
corresponding call content at the
LEA. The transmission of this data
on two completely separate paths
is of benefit to the LEA for two
reasons:

Fixed/Mobile Networks

All the advantages of a tried-and-tested standard
network solution have been incorporated into this
network of the future. For you, the network operator, the
LI solution for number-based traffic in Next Generation
Networks is one more argument to move into the world
of IP. For the LEA, this is an important addition to the
range of targets it can monitor.

14

... in Next Generation Networks ...
Future-oriented
Nokia Siemens Networks facilitates
the migration process through a
variety of solutions designed to
incorporate existing TDM networks
into an IP core network. Of course,
this also includes an IP-based
solution for LI, for secure and
discreet interception of numberbased traffic (i.e. voice and fax
connection as well as ISDN data
transmissions) in Next Generation
Networks.

As in TDM networks, the interception
is set up, started and ended in
a dialog between the IMS LI
management system and the
network element which controls
the traffic to or from the monitored
number. In this solution it is a
standard softswitch.
Once the LI instance has been
activated, this network element
– in a dialog with various gateways –
arranges for all the traffic concerning
the target number to be routed via an

Next Generation Networks

LI server. Thanks to the appropriate
precautions, the subscriber does not
notice anything.
The packages duplicated in
this server and readdressed in
accordance with the instructions
from the softswitch are then
forwarded in the IP network to a
gateway, from where they are sent to
the LEA’s monitoring equipment.
The IRI generated in the softswitch
reaches the LEA via IMS,
independent of the call content.
Even in this purely IP-based solution,
the intercepted data may be sent to
up to five LEAs, if required.
It is also possible to monitor FDNs
(foreign directory numbers).

... and on the internet
The internet has become an
increasingly complex formation
of public and private computer
networks that now also includes
wireless transmission media. Every
day masses of data pass through
this global network used by more
and more people who exchange
information and keep in contact in
many different ways.
The ETSI specifications on the
monitoring of internet users are
in place and are already met by
the Monitoring Center. The Nokia
Siemens Networks concept offers
LEAs a comprehensive solution
to help them fight crime on and
via the internet. The end-to-end
components of this solution are

Customized
By means of integrated LI
functionality in the components
of the IP network as well as by
separate high-performance data
collectors data can be intercepted
and filtered based on predefined
criteria.
According to the requirements,
interception can be deployed at
different access points: At the
internet access provider, the internet
service provider, or the internet
backbone itself.
A mediation device used for adapting
interfaces and also re-filtering, if
necessary, distributes the required
data to the LEAs.
Several types of data collectors with
different interfaces and throughputs
are available. Combined with
individual mediation devices which
also directly interface to LI-enabled
IP network components, they
produce perfectly tailored solutions.

For the network operator the LI solution is a secure
and yet flexible basis to easily record huge volumes
of intercepted data in this telecommunications area.
For the LEA it is an efficient means to pursue leads in
the global network. And for the internet it is powerful,
reliable and for lease, according to your preference.

16

As part of the Siemens ‘Lawful
Interception and Monitoring concept’,
these data collectors team up with
the LI components and IMS or
the Monitoring Center to produce
a comprehensive solution that
meets all the needs of both network
operators and LEAs.
They can also be used on a vendorindependent basis for secure,
reliable and verifiable collection of
voice and data communication on
the internet.
The integrated LI functionality
and the data collectors outlined
here record all types of IP-based
telecommunication, including web
sessions, email and chats, from
• internet service/acess providers
• internet backbone connections
• internet core computers and all
other IP sources.

Efficient

Secure

Lawful interception is set up and
managed in the data collectors
by means of an appropriate and
powerful interception management
system such as IMS. This will be
used by the the LI operator not
only to define the destination of the
recorded data flow but also to set
the above-mentioned filters, if the
filtering has not yet been done by an
LI function in the IP network.

Any system connected to the
internet is at great risk of coming
under attack. This risk has been
minimized in the solution described.
Virtual private networks, anti-virus
and anti-hacker tools and special
firewalls are used to protect both the
interception management tool (IMS)
and the LEA’s equipment for data
reception and processing (e.g. the
Nokia Siemens Networks Monitoring
Center).

These filters, which might contain
e.g. an email, a website address or
even the IP address of the target
subscriber, scale down the huge
volume of data passing through the
data collector to the bare minimum,
before this is forwarded to the
recipient’s equipment (e.g. the Nokia
Siemens Networks Monitoring
Center). This greatly simplifies and
speeds up the evaluation work to be
carried out by the investigator.

Our Monitoring Center
	 a perfect match

The interception has been
activated. The process is
running. Information from
various sources is flowing
along different paths into
your equipment.
What now?
The incoming data has to
be decoded and allocated
to its specific case. Any
misunderstandings or
confusion arising here
could have serious
consequences. During
evaluation, even the tiniest
of details may need to
undergo more in-depth
analysis.
How can you protect
this valuable data from
manipulation or theft? And
what happens in the case
of a power outage?
To meet this challenging
task, law enforcement
agencies in more than 60
countries around the world
place their trust in the
Nokia Siemens Networks
Monitoring Center.

Flexible

Our Monitoring Center is an
extremely versatile construction of
software and hardware modules. Its
various components work together
in perfect harmony, enabling it to
perform all the LI-related tasks of a
law enforcement agency in a secure,
reliable and verifiable manner; from
decoding, converting, correlating and
analyzing the information received,
to its storage and interpretation, and
even a wide range of administrative
tasks. As part of the Nokia Siemens
Networks ‘Lawful Interception and
Monitoring concept’, the Monitoring
Center teams up with the network
components and the IMS to form a
comprehensive solution that meets
all the needs of both, network
operators and LEAs.

Changes to requirements?
Heterogeneous network

By virtue of its ETSI compliance
and modular architecture, it can also
be incorporated into all monitoring
solutions based on the telecom
systems of other leading vendors.
The Nokia Siemens Monitoring
Center monitors all types of voice,

comprises Front-End and BackEnd components (see illustration),
makes it extremely flexible. The
individual Front-Ends which support
the interfaces from the different
telecommunications networks can
be adapted to match a wide variety
of communications systems and
replaced or expanded as necessary.
Thus, the system can be modified or
expanded at all times on the basis
of the existing hardware and/or

The Nokia Siemens Networks
	 Monitoring Center
Process-optimized

User-friendly

As a primary function, the wide
range of automated processes
supports and facilitates the
investigator’s work. This begins
with the incoming information. The
various Front-Ends first decode the
data received from the networks
– widely varying in terms of both
type and volume – and convert it into
a uniform system-internal format.
Subsequently, the processed data is
forwarded to the Back-End.

Regardless of whether the LEA is
monitoring phone calls, reading
the content of a fax or SMS, or
for instance evaluating an internet
chat session, it always controls
the individual processes on the
user interface in the same intuitive
manner, irrespectively of any system
expansions.

The Back-End, where the incoming
content and IRI are combined and
automatically assigned to the
corresponding interception case and
stored in folders, offers a Windowsbased user interface which is made
up of two components.
The benefit is an immediate access
to call content – even if IRIs are
delayed. And this happens quite
often.

Our Monitoring Center offers
different operating modes for
receiving and recording data
intercepted in the network; some of
these are automatically controlled,
some manually configured,
according to requirements.
This greatly simplifies the
investigator’s work and allows a
more efficient deployment of system
resources.

The system automatically detects
if a fax or data transmission begins
during the recording of a telephone
conversation. It then accordingly
switches to the ‘high quality’ or
‘high speed’ recording mode.
This subsequently guarantees a
successful demodulation of the
digital signals during transmissions
which use the entire bandwidth.
Various levels of compression
available to economize on storage
space when recording voice calls
two modes available when setting up
monitoring in IMS
• stereo (advantage: both
conversation directions can
subsequently be interpreted
separately or together)
• mono (saves online capacity)

The Management Station (MS)
enables the system administrator
to adapt the configuration of our
Monitoring Center to the LEA’s
changing requirements at all times.
The Unified User Station (UUS) is a
versatile part that assists the LEA in
performing day-to-day monitoring
tasks. It provides the LEAs with all
recordings and other information
from the network in an optimized
form with the click of the mousebutton. The LEA can quickly and
easily retrieve the LI information sent
from the network from the folder in
which it is stored. Thanks to systeminternal fax and data demodulation/
decoding, the recorded signals are
displayed as readable documents on
the screen (e.g. as a fax page or a
web page).

20

Bringing the LEA closer to its target…
The UUS (Unified User Station) of our
Monitoring Center supports the LEA with a
Windows-based user-friendly interface for
data evaluation, for example in wiretapping.

Innovative
A significant number of add-ons
are available to complete the scope
of the Nokia Siemens Networks
Monitoring Center.
Offering efficient means of pursuing
leads, these are all most valuable to
investigative work.
One example is location tracking
by means of the Geographic
Information System (GIS):

Within mobile telephone networks,
this feature determines the current
location of the marked mobile device
(with variable accuracy within and
between networks).
The obtained information is
transmitted to the Nokia Siemens
Networks Monitoring Center (in the
form of IRI).

There it is visualized on a map on
which the user’s (or at least the
phone’s) current movements and
route can be tracked live – as long
as the corresponding data continues
to flow.
System users have a number of
different map views and layers to
select from.

Powerful filters help the LEA to quickly identify the
important conversation.

With the Audio Player, the LEA can
recognize the stage of the inter­
cepted telephone call and, simply
by using the cursor, move to any
point in the conversation.
It also has a number of buttons,
e.g.for volume, speed or voice
­characteristics to operate the
system like a CD player and, if the
call has been recorded in ­stereo,
listen to each side of the call
­separately.

When it comes to data and system
protection, the Nokia Siemens
Networks Monitoring Center is again
an excellent choice, and one that
also meets the customer’s special
needs.

Special precautions have been
taken to ensure that the casespecific folders, which store all the
data intercepted in the course of
monitoring, cannot be confused or
mixed up under any circumstances.

Through its modular, multilevel
security and control concept for
authorities, administrators, groups of
LEAs and individual LEAs, it can be
adapted to meet the requirements of
individual organizational structures
and different legal requirements.

An entire range of special systeminternal measures protect the
recorded data from manipulation,
theft or destruction. If necessary,
all of these mechanisms may be
reinforced (e.g. against hacking or
other internet threats) by firewalls,
VPNs or virus/intrusion protection
tools.

Unauthorized system access is
prevented by means of a series of
protective mechanisms involving
individual passwords coupled with
user-specific rights.

System components can also be
duplicated to guarantee system
availability and prevent the loss of
any saved data. And in order to
prevent data getting lost in the case
of a power outage during monitoring,
the Nokia Siemens Networks

Monitoring Center
	The Third Millennium began with a world of open borders and
easy trafficking, a global village where any major destination
can be reached within 24 hours.
		Never before could information be exchanged so
rapidly and in so many ways.
Needless to say that criminal groups and terrorist organizations also
have been quick to realize the vast opportunities presented by modern
communications.
When it comes to fighting crime and thwarting
terrorist attacks, law enforcement and government
security agencies need the right tools to get
results and fulfill their mandate. Therefore,
state-of-the-art monitoring center solutions are
an absolute ‘must’ for lawful interception (LI).
By monitoring the communications of specific
groups or individuals, law enforcement agencies
(LEAs) can discover hidden patterns and criminal
structures, anticipate and prevent crimes, and
collect hard and fast evidence for prosecution.
The Nokia Siemens Networks Monitoring Center
(MC) has been specifically developed to service
the complex needs of law enforcement agencies
worldwide. It is completely user-friendly in that
it offers a unified view of all intercepted data,
regardless of their source. No matter what
kind of data or from whichever sort of network,
the Monitoring Center presents them in a
standardized way because its unique architecture
can concurrently handle all technologies and

vendors. It is both, flexible and scalable and
performs the tasks of monitoring in an auditable,
secure, reliable and verifiable manner, according
to ETSI LI standards.
The Nokia Siemens Networks Monitoring Center
is deployed all over the world. So far more than 90
Monitoring Center solutions have been installed in
over 60 countries.

The Monitoring Center is the perfect match
for LEAs’ needs for efficient monitoring
and prompt evaluation of all types of
communication – today, tomorrow and after
tomorrow.

Intelligence Solutions
		 Keep your eyes open
The Nokia Siemens Networks Monitoring Center
can be used for intercepting communications in
public fixed and mobile circuit-switched networks,
Next Generation Networks (NGN) and the
internet.
It has been designed for integration within every
telecommunications network – with any type of
modern standardized switch following the ETSI
recommendation (e.g. Nokia Siemens Networks,
Ericsson, Alcatel, Nortel, Lucent, Motorola,
Huawei). Customers vastly benefit from this multivendor capability as it allows easy interaction with
lawful interception solutions in heterogeneous
network infrastructures.
The Monitoring Center monitors two general types
of intercept: Voice and data.
However, within those two types it manages the
following more specific types
• internet sessions (e.g. web sessions, e-mail,
chat, VoIP)
• voice conversations
• fax transmissions
• location-based information for mobile networks
(location-tracking, GIS)
• SMS and MMS messages
• modem transmissions including local loop
internet
• call related information
• DTMF in-band transmissions

The Monitoring Center supports interceptions from
the following sources
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

fixed networks PSTN
mobile networks GSM, CDMA, GPRS, UMTS
Next Generation Networks (NGN)
IP Networks: Local loop, ISP, and the internet
trunk monitoring (passive interception)
satellite monitoring (passive interception)
surveillance equipment

The Monitoring Center is an extremely versatile
construction of interoperating software and
hardware modules. It performs all LI-related
tasks on the intercepted information – storage
and interpretation as well as a wide range of
administrative tasks – in a secure, auditable,
reliable and verifiable manner. Because of its
LI-conceived modular architecture, it is flexible
enough to be configured as an IP interception
and delivery solution to other law enforcement
monitoring facilities (LEMFs).

	 Intelligence Solutions
		 Lawful Interception
The Nokia Siemens Networks Monitoring
Center offers different operating modes to
receive and record the intercepted data, some
of which are automatically controlled and some
manually configured, according to the customer’s
requirements and operational needs.

In contrast, target monitoring may be a result of
service monitoring, but it is also an independent
investigative method to be used by authorized
groups.

The operating modes greatly simplify the
investigative work of LEAs and allow them to
deploy more efficiently Monitoring Center system

•
•
•
•
•
•

• to discover hidden patterns and unlawful
activities
• to anticipate and prevent crimes
• to take action and provide evidence for
prosecution – and –
• to secure peace and prosperity among ­
law-abiding citizens
Service and target monitoring are two different
types of lawful interception. They may differ
in scale and intent, but they both use granular
triggering and filtering to fulfill their ultimate
purpose.
Service monitoring
• is pro-active, even in the worldwide web
• controls the entire communications spectrum of
possible targets (e.g. suspected pedophile chat
rooms and websites)
• checks either each single segment of intercept
or those clearly defined
• trawls in both clear and dirty water, looks for
potentially unlawful activities
• generates suspects who eventually become the
object of target monitoring
• defines and refines new strategic or tactical
approaches
• typically requires huge data storage but smaller
archiving space
• is usually used by secret services



Target monitoring
is re-active
checks on a particular person or defined groups
collects specific data
controls all activities of a defined target
will possibly be used in a judicial process
needs typically lesser data storage but larger
archiving space
• is usually used by LEAs and police forces for
collecting evidence on specific persons or
groups
The Nokia Siemens Networks Monitoring Center
has been designed to perform both service and
target monitoring, according to the customer’s
needs and requirements with characteristic
intercept features like
• detailed trigger mechanisms allowing the
interception of the “needle in the haystack”
• fine filters permitting investigators to discern the
important data
• hot monitoring warning investigators on
the targets’ activities, allowing near realtime listening, viewing and/or reading of the
communication
• live monitoring for forwarding intercepted calls
to agents in the field
• single unified view of all interception types
presented to the user
The Monitoring Center’s unified view for all
intercepts greatly facilitates the tasks of LEAs.
If need be, different national and international
agencies may grant each other access rights and
easily exchange crucial information. Consequently,
the concept of agencies cooperating across
institutional or national boundaries becomes
reality.

Highlights
• monitoring of all types of voice, fax and data
communication in fixed as well as mobile public
networks and the internet
• smooth interaction with lawful interception
solutions in heterogeneous network
infrastructures

The Monitoring Center – one solution for
all networks, vendors and technologies
meets the monitoring requirements of LEAs
worldwide.

Benefits

The Architecture
The Nokia Siemens Networks
Monitoring Center architecture of
Front-End and Back-End parts
results from the necessity to
interface with a wide range of
networks and technologies. This
design is the core essence of its
success.
Front-Ends
The Front-End components are
specific for the target network
such as mobile networks or the
internet. Multiple Front-Ends are
used to connect to different switch
manufacturers’ interfaces and to
appropriately scale to the size of the
networks. The data vary widely in
terms of type and volume and need to
be converted into a uniform systeminternal format. Consequently, all
voice and other data received from
networks are transformed into a
single internal format and passed on
to the Back-End.
Back-End
The Back-End receives the
processed data from the Front-End
components, correlates content and
Intercept Related Information (IRI)
and automatically assigns it to the
corresponding folders as configured
in the system. The Back-End offers a
Windows-based user interface made
up of two components:
The Management Station (MS)
The MS enables the system
administrator to adapt the
configuration of the Monitoring Center
to the LEAs’ changing requirements
at anytime, and to perform routine
administrative tasks such as adding
new users or folders to the system.



The Unified User Station (UUS)
The UUS provides the LEA-user with
all recordings and other information
from the network in an optimized
form. Thus, the user can easily
and quickly retrieve the relevant
LI information from the respective
folders. System-internal fax and data
demodulation and decoding allow the
recorded signals to be displayed as
readable documents on the screen
(e.g. fax, SMS, web pages). Powerful
filters help the LEA to quickly locate,
listen to and replay relevant phone
conversations.
The Nokia Siemens Networks
Monitoring Center can never be
outdated.
On-demand upgrades
The world of communications is
ever-changing: New technologies
and ways of communication are
constantly invented, Next Generation
Networks infrastructures established,
higher data volumes need to be
handled and multiple types of
communications monitored.
Requirements may change –
our Monitoring Center will remain
the perfect match. Despite the
complexity, its modular design
of Front-End and Back-End
components guarantee extreme
flexibility. The individual Front-Ends,
which supply the interfaces to the
different networks, can easily be
adapted to match new requirements.
But either can be modified, expanded
or replaced as necessary, at any
time. Yet the management and
presentation essentially remain the
same. This has many benefits for the
user: The system does not need to
be expanded more than necessary.

This means that there are no ‘forklift’ upgrades – no total software or
hardware replacements. Customers
only have to invest in those modules
they actually need. The result is a
tailored solution that satisfies their
requirements at all times.
Scalable
Depending on the applications, the
system installations can vary in
size - from a few computers to an
extensive system of many recorders,
data collectors, system servers and
clients. The complexity ranges from
passive connection to a single trunk
line that is responsible for monitoring
an entire nation’s fixed, mobile, NGN
and internet networks.
Distributable
The Nokia Siemens Networks
MC performs its monitoring and
management tasks from a scalable,
distributable and reliable platform
(LAN, WAN, MAN) with facilities
which ensure the safety of system
and intercepted data.
Reliable
Intercepted data is valuable.
Customers need to be able to rely
on the Monitoring Center solution,
which must protect the system
sufficiently so that neither
manipulation nor theft or even power
outage can corrupt the data (e.g.
server protection, UPS concepts,
RAID strategy, etc.). In addition,
the Monitoring Center offers mass
storage and archiving solutions
(e.g. NAS, SAN). Various levels
of compression are available to
economize on storage space, if
needed.

The Nokia Siemens Networks
Monitoring Center is extremely flexible
• it can be integrated into any existing
infrastructure and is applicable to
a vast range of monitoring tasks,
whether fixed, mobile or internet
• it can be configured as an IP
interception and delivery solution for
other LEMFs
• it is – on-demand and without
compromises – scalable and adaptable
to the size of the organization



Intelligence Solutions

The Monitoring Center’s secure environment
comprises

•

network security
physical security
logical security
link security
data and capability access security

The Monitoring Center has a modular,
multilevel security and control-concept for
authorities, administrators and LEAs. This
can be adapted to meet the requirements
of individual organizational structures and
different legal requirements.
Special precautions have been taken to ensure
that, under any circumstances, the intercepted
data cannot be, confused or mixed up.
A range of special system internal and external
measures (firewalls, VPNs, virus/intrusion
protection tools, etc.) safeguard the recorded
data against manipulation, theft or destruction.
System components can also be duplicated to

10

guarantee system availability and prevent the loss
of stored data. Using an appropriately specified
uninterruptible power supply (UPS) concept, the
Monitoring Center has been designed to survive
power outages.
The Nokia Siemens Monitoring Center is
extremely secure and reliable because of its
•

multiple, granular levels
holistic security-concept
flexible configuration
sophisticated user-rights and access control
mechanisms

Database
Its database allows for add-on applications.
These can either be provided by Nokia Siemens
Networks or the customer himself integrates the
data in the infrastructure by means of defined
interfaces.

Nokia Siemens Networks constantly seeks to
augment the service-scope of the Monitoring
Center, not only by addressing emerging
communications trends but also by making further
use of information which is already at hand and
by providing additional intelligence. Hence a wide
range of add-on applications is available, such as:
Mobile Location Tracking (MLT)
Based on a Geographical Information System
(GIS), the MLT is an ideal solution to track, record,
extrapolate, and anticipate the movements of
mobile devices. Within mobile networks, the
current location of marked mobile devices can be
determined. The intercept related information (IRI)
is transmitted to the Monitoring Center. There,
the so-called footprints of the mobile device are
visualized on a map on which the user’s (or rather
the device’s) current movements and route can be
tracked.

Link analysis
Link analysis may be used to find and graphically
display correlating data of intercepted targets.
This kind of information, which cannot be
achieved manually, reveals previously unknown
relationships between targets.
Plaese have a look at our application notes.

Lawful Interception of Telecommunication Services
Throughout the world telecommunication services providers are required to
support law enforcement agencies in their fight against crime and terrorism.
Network operators and telecommunication service providers must provide
interception capabilities in their network for people under surveillance. The legal
framework of lawful interception (LI) is defined by national laws and regulations
and is complemented by various international technical standards.
LIMS (Lawful Interception Management System) is a proven solution for network
operators and service providers for the management of all LI related activities. The
system is based on a central management platform for the surveillance of
communication services and represents the interface to all authorized law enforcement agencies and their monitoring centers.
LIMS offers the broadest range of supported network elements, which enables
lawful interception in virtually any fixed, mobile and Internet service provider’s
environment without any negative impact on the performance and reliability of the
network. Communication services supported include voice, fax, SMS, MMS, email, voicemail, VoIP, Push-to-Talk, as well as various other Internet services. While
the system is designed for large-scale networks with millions of subscribers, the
LIMS suite can easily be adapted to provide an economically feasible solution for
networks with only a few thousand users. The modular architecture of LIMS
facilitates cost-effective extension and adaptation to new technologies and
regulatory requirements.
The design concept of LIMS complies with international LI standards of ETSI,
3GPP, ANSI, and PacketCable and satisfies the highest security requirements to
protect the privacy of all associated data.
We support providers and carriers seeking lawful interception solutions by offering
consulting and technical support services and also provide managed service
models, together with qualified solution partners.

Zebra Optical Gateway
The Zebra optical gateway is designed to connect the Zebra monitoring centre
system to SDH/SONET and E3/DS3 telephony networks. It provides a highly dense
connectivity solution: 2 bi-directional STM1/OC3 carriers can be intercepted in a
single 1U 19” rack module. The unit supports 1 STM4/OC12 input. An expansion
module (currently under development) provides connectivity for 12 E3/DS3 inputs.
Used in conjunction with the Zebra monitoring centre system, the Zebra gateway
provides a very powerful telecommunications monitoring solution.
Unlike general purpose media gateways and protocol converters, the Zebra
gateway is designed to support the requirements of communication monitoring.
This allows the Zebra monitoring centre system to support features that were not
possible with the previous generation of monitoring equipment, for example:
The Zebra gateway and Zebra monitoring centre system can process primary rate
carriers containing only SS7 signaling timeslots (e.g.: 31 signaling timeslots on an
E-1)
The Zebra gateway supports any combination of hyper channels (consecutive
timeslots used together to provide one bigger n x 64 kbps channel) together
with E0/D0 (64 kbps) channels on the same carrier

-

The Zebra gateway supports channelized E1/T1, E3/DS3 and STM1/OC3
(unframed streams used as bit streams)

-

E1/T1, E0/DS0 channels, hyper channels and channelized carriers can be mixed
on the same gateway

-

The Zebra optical gateway can be used in conjunction with other Zebra
gateways (for example: the Zebra E1/T1 gateway) in the same Zebra monitoring
centre system

-

The Zebra monitoring centre system reads data from the Zebra gateway over
Ethernet, allowing the processing of monitored streams to be farmed out to as
many servers on the network as required for the connected capacity. This
allows a Zebra system to be scaled up to an unprecedented capacity of over
150 000 monitored channels in a single system

Telephone Line Monitoring Zebra System

The Zebra system is a powerful telecommunications monitoring solution. It
combines support for ETSI Lawful Interception with very dense passive monitoring
in one hybrid solution. The Zebra system is suitable for law enforcement as well as
intelligence gathering and is scalable from 16 E1 carriers (or equivalent channels)
to more than 5,000 E1 carriers (or equivalent) in one integrated system.

System overview
Figure 1 shows how the Zebra system couples to the carriers of telephony
networks. Active FTP and ISDN PRI protocol stacks support the ETSI LI handover
interfaces 2 and 3 for circuit and packet switched interceptions. Passive SS7,
R2MFC and SS5 protocol stacks support passive monitoring between switches in
a carrier network, as well as between the gateway switches. The same passive
protocol stacks support interception of satellite streams. A passive ISDN stack
supports trunk-side interception of PBX traffic.
The support for these interfaces and protocols allow the Zebra system to be
applied to any type of monitoring in the carrier network, including PSTN and PLMN
networks.

Passive Telecommunications Monitoring System

The Zebra system can capture intercepts in the following modes:
Passively – the system connects passively to carriers or bearers between
switches. Hi-Z buffers hide the Zebra system from the monitored network. No
additional load is placed on the monitored network. Sessions on the monitored
carriers/bearers are detected by protocol analysis or VOX activity. The system can
be configured to record all traffic on the monitored carriers/bearers.

The switches make calls to the Zebra system over ETSI LI HI3 containing the
content of the circuit switched monitored sessions and push files containing the
content of packet switched monitored sessions to a file server of the Zebra
system.
Intercept related information is sent to the Zebra system by switches of the
monitored network over ETSI LI HI2.
Passive monitoring is typically used for large scale intelligence gathering while
active monitoring/LI is mainly used for law enforcement.
A Zebra system can be configured to support both actively and passively
monitored interfaces in one system.
Passive monitoring
The Zebra system is a very powerful passive monitoring system. Figure 2 shows
the configuration of a passive Zebra system (coupling to monitored carriers not
shown) with the following capabilities:
Connect to 384 bi-directional E1 carriers.
Record every session on every channel.
Store all intercepts for 7 days.
Demodulate all fax and internet sessions.

Figure 2. 384 x E1 passive monitoring system

Such a system is capable of monitoring any configuration of protocols on its
input carriers, including: SS7 ISUP and TUP, SS5, R2MFC. When no signaling is
available recordings can be triggered on VOX. Future versions of the system
will support H.323, SIP and other packet protocols.

These protocols are normally transmitted on n × 64 kbps hyper channels, as
well as unstructured PDH and SDH/SONET carriers. A system can support a
mixture of PDH and SDH/SONET interfaces, e.g.: E1 and STM4.
The philosophy of the Zebra passive monitoring system can be summarized as:
store everything, filter for known targets, and search the past for new targets.

Active monitoring
The Zebra system supports ETSI LI handover interfaces 1 and 2 as specified in
ETSI TS 101 671 V2.13.1 (2006-01).

Figure 3. Zebra 128 E1/T1 gateway

The Zebra enhanced user station will support user access to all LI meta data by
2007Q1.
The Zebra system connects to monitored networks by means of the Zebra
gateway. The Zebra gateway is used to extract monitored TDM traffic and send it
to processing servers of a switched local area network. This approach has a
number of advantages:
-

Supports all types of channels – the Zebra system can process any combination
of individual E0 (64 kbps) TDM channels, n×64 kbps hyper channels and
unstructured primary rate (1.544/2 Mbps) streams.
Unlimited scalability – the Zebra gateway sends the contents of each monitored
stream to the server requesting it. This allows the monitored traffic to be
fanned out to as many servers as required for the load.
Density – the Zebra E1 gateway couples 128 E1 inputs in each 1U 19” rack
module. This helps to reduce the footprint of a monitoring system significantly.
For example, Figure 2 shows a system capable of storing and processing 100%
of the traffic on 384 bi-directional E1 streams in a single 19” cabinet.

3

The Zebra E1/T1 gateway supports long haul and short haul termination (down to 45 dB) at 120Ω, 100Ω and 75Ω.
The Zebra 128 × E1/T1 gateway is currently available. A gateway for SDH STM-1
and STM-4 as well as E3/DS3 will be available in 2007Q1. Both E1/T1 and
SDH/E3/DS3 gateways can be used in the same system.

Coupling
The Zebra system can couple actively or passively to monitored networks.

Passive coupling is used for passive trunk monitoring applications and is invisible
to the monitored network. No network resources are consumed by the passive
monitoring of carriers.
Active coupling is typically used for ETSI LI monitoring. The network actively
couples with the monitoring equipment and makes monitoring calls to the
monitoring equipment. Monitored network resources are required for making the
observed calls to the monitor centre.
The management of large amounts of carrier cable can be a challenge, especially in
large passive monitoring systems. We offer a modular coupling system that
supports the connectivity management of large numbers of monitored carriers in
conjunction with optional high impedance buffering (Hi-Z) and LED indication of the
status of passively monitored carriers. One coupling frame is required for each
Zebra E1 gateway to connect to 128 E1 inputs (64 bi-directional).

CONFIDENTIAL

Passive Telecommunications Monitoring System

Figure 4. Coupling

Figure 5 shows a Zebra coupling frame for 128 twisted pairs. This coupling frame
occupies 9U rack space.
See reference [3] for more detail.
Hi-Z buffering
We offer an optional hi-z buffer with the Zebra coupling frame (Figure 5). The Hi-Z
buffer module consists of a single printed circuit board that mounts behind the
coupling board. It has a smaller profile than the coupling board and, therefore,
consumes no additional rack space.
The Zebra Hi-Z buffer ensures that any signal flowing back to the monitored
network is at least 20 dB attenuated and, therefore, prevents interference with the
monitored carriers. Hi-Z buffering is used in passive monitoring applications where
the Zebra system T’s off live monitored carriers between switches (Figure 4,
passive coupling).
Another application of the Hi-Z buffer is to split an E1 input off to multiple devices,
for example, redundant gateways, protocol analyzers, etc. See reference [3] for
more detail.

Access control
The configuration and intercepts stored in the Zebra system are only accessible to
authorized users of the Zebra system.
User workstation
We currently offers a basic user station for filtering and browsing stored
intercepts, playing audio and viewing fax/modem intercepts.
The Zebra enhanced user station that will offer sophisticated filtering and
searching, playback and visualization of content, as well as the viewing of
fax/Internet sessions, will become available by 2007Q1.

Health monitoring

Migration between Zebra deployment units
Modern interception systems are often geographically distributed. The Zebra
system supports the migration of intercepts between geographically distributed
Zebra deployment units. A set of filters can be configured to determine which
intercepts are migrated.

3

Migration filters select intercepts based on telephone numbers and content type
(for example, voice, fax and data).
It is possible to configure remote deployment units to pre-process intercepts
before migration, for example, compression of voice recordings or demodulation
and decoding of fax and internet intercepts. By configuring migration filters to
migrate processed intercepts more information can be migrated over a WAN link.
Compression
Intercepts are stored at the original compression rate (e.g.: G.711 A-law or μ-law).
Many processes, like fax/modem demodulation and speaker identification, require
audio in the original format. Voice intercepts can be compressed:

Any codec available for the Linux system can be integrated with the Zebra system.
The following codecs are available by default and free of licensing constraints:
1. G.711 A-law and μ-law.
2. Speex 5 kbps – 15 kbps.

Portable Modem Interception

The unit is a true portable modem
intercept solution to be used in
operations where direct access to
the target lines is required.
This unit can be deployed in the field
close to the target or installed on a
permanent basis, for example, in a
monitoring center. Due to the unique
design of the physical line interface
the
system
is
completely
undetectable by the target and is
transparent to all parties on the line, making it ideal for all covert operations.

4

System Summary
The system is delivered as a complete turnkey solution, including all cables and
accessories. It consists of a high quality and specially designed PSTN line interface
and a lunchbox computer for recording and decoding. It is very easy to operate and
it only needs a few hours of training to use it at its fullest potential.
The system intercepts all dialup modem traffic on a two wire analog PSTN line,
and has no influence on normal voice or fax traffic on the intercepted target line.
V.90 and V.92 is supported but will be trained down to 33.600 from the interface
box towards the target.
The target line is connected in sequence to the line interface box that in turn
connects to the lunchbox computer; power it up and you are ready to go.
You can listen to any Voice over IP traffic. The audio player contains an automatic
gain control filter to enhance the audio.
With these advanced tools you are able to follow whatever the target is doing on
the internet and easily pinpoint any illegal activity.

The intercepted traffic is decoded into readable information for access to a broad
range of tools for dealing with the intercepted data.

Portable IP Monitoring System

The ever increasing mobility of communication in our society with laptops, mobile
phones, WLAN and PDAs has its drawbacks. The mobile criminal offender takes
advantage of gaps in the criminal prosecution, like monitoring of WLAN-spots,
internet-cafes, hotel rooms and airports. With our Portable IP Monitoring System
we want to help close these gaps.
The Unit is a portable system for recording, reconstruction and evaluation of IPdata and their applications, e.g. email, web-sessions, and chat.

4

The System supports surveillance teams and S.W.A.T. to receive relevant
information on location immediately and guarantees the access.

It consists of three functional parts. The recording of the raw data, picked up from
different kinds of communication lines, the database management for internal
organizational purposes of these data and the reconstruction function to analyze
and evaluate the recorded IP-based data.
The Internet has produced a veritable flood of communication options, which are
also being used by criminal offenders.
Our Company is an innovative provider of technology and services for monitoring,
recording and reconstructing of telecommunications data for carriers and law
enforcement agencies.

CONFIDENTIAL

8

Internet Monitoring (Strategic & Tactical)

The System reads the data, filters them according to predefined filter criteria
(depending on the specific usage and the legal regulations), adds a timestamp to
the data and saves it in raw format in a database. Using the Analyzer User
Interface the data can be reconstructed und evaluated – online or offline,
residential or on location. For archiving purposes the saved raw data can be
exported automatically or manually via FTP to already existing archiving media. Reimporting of archived raw data is also possible.

The service concept of the company enables carriers and Internet Service
Providers (ISPs) to meet their statutory obligations in the most cost-effective way.
With the Monitoring Center offered by the company and with the IP Monitoring
product line state-of-the-art solutions are available for the law enforcement
agencies to reconstruct, analyze and archive all kinds of communication data
(voice, facsimile, modem and IP-data). The Company solutions are based strictly on
the statutory specifications of the country concerned. In Germany, for instance,
these are embodied in the Telecommunications Monitoring Ordinance (known
under its German acronym ‘TKUEV’)

IP Data Monitoring

This unit is for the recording, reconstruction and evaluation of IP-data, which is
passively recorded from different communication lines.
The unit reads the IP-data, filters it according to predefined filter criteria, adds a
timestamp to the IP-data (NTP-Server) and stores it in raw format in its own
database.
With the Graphical User Interface
(GUI) the recorded IP-data can –
even online – be reconstructed and
evaluated. For archiving purposes
the
stored
raw
data
can
automatically or manually be
exported via FTP to already
existing archiving media. Re-importing of archived raw data is also possible.

4

Additional Entry
The unit’s database combined with its powerful search functions enables the user
to search for detailed activities and applications, recorded during weeks or even
months. Within seconds he gets the list of communication data and content
generated during a defined period of time, for example, by a specific host together
with its IP-address.
The unit consists of three functional groups:
Recording of raw IP-data, tapped from different communication links
Database Management
Reconstruction of IP-data
IP-data can be received by the unit via a wide range of Network Interface Cards
(NICs) because it has the ability to record directly from the communication lines.
The connection is realized with either network tap(s), SPAN-Port(s) or Mirror
Port(s).

For reconstruction of the stored IP-data a standard web-browser (e.g. MS Internet
Explorer) is used, which has access to the unit via the integrated Ethernet
Management Interface. The Internet Explorer is connected to the implemented
Web-Server, which provides the GUI for reconstructing the data. By using simple
mouse clicks user requests are transmitted to the database.
A GUI is available for the user. It is used, depending on the user rights granted, to
configure the unit, to set-up monitoring tasks, for user administration, alarm
management, data export/import and finally for reconstructing the IP-data.

Important: All of the available NICs are passive, which means they are only able to
receive data and cannot transmit any data. For that reason the unit is totally
„invisible“ in a communication network and cannot be identified.

characters or character combinations within the complete TCP-communication.
The results are presented as a list showing all the communication by application

In their efforts to generate value for their organizations, networking engineers are
constrained by available applications' platforms. Open conventional servers are
unable to perform at the speeds of the network, and high-speed appliances are
closed, inaccessible, and often fixed function systems. In-Network Computing
combines the best of these computing architectures resulting in a multi-purpose,
high-speed programmable packet processing platform. The CS-2000 removes the
barriers to innovation and service development.
The major innovation in the CS-2000 is the programmable Deep Packet Processing
Module, or DPPM. The DPPM provides a complete set of computing resources
and instruction sets designed for, and dedicated to, packet processing in the data
plane. The DPPM delivers ASIC-based appliance performance in a general

Faster, more CPUs is Not the Answer
CPUs, RAM, bus and disk drive technologies all benefit from continued
performance improvements. However, the one area where CPU-based computing
platforms fall short is network performance. The problem is not CPU speed, but its
design.
The CS 2000 has created a new network applications' platform - a general purpose
deep packet processing platform combined with an open Linux server blade. It is
designed for applications focused on real-time network traffic processing.

This results in:
- No more CPU interrupt latency
- No more PCI bus bandwidth constraints
- The power to operate on every packet – every bit of every packet – on the wire in
real-time
The CS-2000 also provides conventional Linux server resources for off-line analysis
and non real-time application functions.

The ASM is a dual 1GHz Pentium server with 1 Gigabyte of RAM and a 60
Gigabyte hard disk. The ASM, today, supports Redhat Enterprise Linux and hosts
the web-based system management server software and database, an SNMP
Agent, and DPPM control APIs. Under normal load, these components utilize less
than 20% of the available ASM resources. That leaves more than 80% of the Linux
server resources for running non real-time application functions.
The CS-2000 is really two computers to create one robust In-Network Computing

Manipulation and Blocking: CS-2000 High End
High Performance Network Platform

Networking engineers are constrained by available applications platforms. Open
conventional servers are unable to perform at the speeds of the network, and
high-speed appliances are closed, inaccessible, and often fixed-function systems.
CS-2000 combines the best of these
computing architectures resulting in
a
multi-purpose,
high-speed
programmable packet processing
platform. With the CS-2000, GTEN removes the barriers to innovation and service
development.
The major innovation in the CS-2000
is the programmable Deep Packet
processing Module, or DPPM. The
DPPM provides a complete set of
computing resources and instruction
sets designed for, and dedicated to,
packet processing in the data plane.
The DPPM provides ASIC-based
appliance performance in a general platform.

Faster, More CPUs is Not the Answer
CPUs, RAM, bus and disk drive technologies all benefit from continued
performance improvements. However, the one area CPU-based computing
platforms fall short is network performance. When heavy packet processing is
required, CPU-based computing platforms cannot keep pace. The problem is not
CPU speed, but its design.

The CS-2000 enables network operators and network applications developers to
implement their ideas, build differentiating service features, deliver benefits to
customers, and bring value to their companies.

Modular System Delivers the Capacity You Need
DPPM–500 Deep Packet Processing Module for high-performance packet
processing applications on Gigabit Ethernet networks. Providing 2 gigabits per
second (Gbps) packet processing performance, the DPPM-500, has 4 Gigabit
Ethernet ports (Copper or Fiber) plus one 1000Base-T Gigabit Ethernet capture
port on the front panel.
DPPM–600 provides DPPM 500 features at full line rate for OC-48 / STM-16
SONET/SDH links. The DPPM-600 supports two OC-48c/STM-16 PoS (Packet over
SONET/SDH) interfaces and up to 2.5 Gbps of packet processing performance.
Network interfaces are OC-3.12 / STM 1.4 capable. RAVE applications can be
executed on either DPPM model without modification.
A proper CS-2000 configuration today includes a single DPPM and a single Linuxbased Application Server Module (ASM). The ASM is a dual Pentium server
with 1 GB of RAM and a 60 GB hard disk. The ASM, supports Linux and hosts the

Manipulation and Blocking: P2P Traffic Filter

This Unit is a filter for peer-to-peer (P2P) traffic. Detection of P2P traffic is
based on protocol signatures, which are updated on a regular basis.
Compared to legacy port-based methods, the number of mismatches is
drastically reduced and thus the filtering does not interfere with normal
network usage. In addition to filtering P2P traffic additional communication
methods like Instant Messenger and VoIP can be filtered.
P2P traffic can be handled in several ways:
•
Block: Blocking prevents any P2P communication taking place
•
Shape: Shaping throttles P2P traffic to an acceptable rate. The
throttling is invisible to users of the network as file sharing applications
continue to work as normal
•
Bridge: All traffic is bridged transparently
•
Statistics: Statistics of P2P usage are generated. This might be useful
to get actual usage data to specify the traffic shaping rules

4

These modes can be activated manually as well as on a configurable time
schedule.
As the unit operates as a transparent bridge it appears completely invisible to
normal network users. Administration personnel can manage the system via a
separate network interface.
An integrated hardware bypass is automatically enabled if the system loses
its power connection. Therefore, the deployment of the unit poses no
negative impact on the reliability of the network. The bypass can also be
manually activated by the administrator.
Administration is done via an intuitive web interface. Besides configuration, it
features detailed graphical statistics on network utilization and P2P usage.
P2P protocols used by file sharing networks are subject to frequent changes
with new protocols appearing every few months. Only regular protocol
signature updates can ensure the filter’s effectiveness.
The maximum throughput is 1.6 Gbits/s. An entry level version with
350MBit/s throughput is available as well.

Application Note

IP Interception System - IPIS

The IP Interception System offers flexible and scalable
solutions to mark and intercept at multiple and varied
points in the Internet and to deliver this data to one or
more authorised Law Enforcement Agencies.
Where integrated in Internet components, IPIS
supports the embedded LI functions. With no
embedded LI, IPIS offers a range of Data Collectors to
capture and filter the data.

Overview
The IP Interception System (IPIS) performs
Lawful Interception (LI) based on captured data
from the Internet, mediation of various
network devices and delivery of the intercepted
data to Law Enforcement Agencies (LEA).
It can operate with the Siemens Monitoring
Center or other Law Enforcement Monitoring
Facilities (LEMF) chosen by the LEA. It supports
the integrated LI functions of market leading
switch and router vendors, and where none is
available, offers a range of Data Collectors to
filter and capture the desired data.
The Data Collectors directly offer Ethernet and
ATM interfaces and bandwidths ranging from
small ISPs to peering points in the Internet.
Other interfaces are supported using adapters.
IPIS can also manage ETSI LI sources.
A well conceived security architecture ensures
access to targets and data only by authorized
persons. Security of both data and
management transmissions is always offered
with IPIS but customer specific solutions can be
easily implemented.

IPIS Applications
The IPIS is capable of intercepting data in the
Internet, in other IP based networks and VoIP in
Next Generation Networks (NGN). It can be
configured to intercept and deliver a range of
data using very granular triggers to select the
types of data or the targets to be intercepted.
The IPIS is used in several application scenarios
including the following:
• Email only interception and delivery
• VoIP interception in NGN
• General Internet interception
All IP data received into the IPIS can be
distributed to LEAs according to ETSI standards.
The LEA can extract IP data based on triggers
set in the IPIS. The following trigger types can
be set in the IPIS:
• Email, such as SMTP, POP3, IMAP4 &
Webmail
• Web/HTTP, FTP or IRC
• VoIP
• Keyword/String Search
• IP Address
• Instant Messaging

Figure 1. LI Network, Mediation and LEMF environment

Background to IP Interception
Most modern Circuit Switched networks have
an integrated Lawful Interception (LI) function.
The Lawful Interception function intercepts the
targeted calls and forwards them to Law
Enforcement Agencies (LEA), as directed by an
Interception Management System (IMS). Metadata about the call (Intercept Related
Information) is sent to the IMS which forwards
it to the appropriate LEA.
In contrast to this mature standards
environment, the Internet is still in the process
of LI standardisation. Most IP interception is
performed by Data Collectors that are located
near or inside the Internet nodes and
essentially filter it for desired data.
There are a few IP Switch and Router vendors
that have started to implement LI functions
and these will become more common in
networks over time.
The varied mixture of Switch or Router
integrated LI function and Data Collectors from
different vendors needs a Mediation and
Delivery application to mediate between the
Internet and the LEA.

Siemens IP Interception System
Siemens offers the IP Interception System to
address the needs of Lawful Interception in the
Internet. There are several components in the
solutions as well as flexible configurations to
suit the needs of the customer. This application
note looks more closely at these solutions from
Siemens.

The Networks
There is an ever-increasing array of networks
that use IP as their data transmission protocol.
The Internet is the first that comes to mind, but
it also includes GPRS, UMTS, VoIP networks –
Next Generation Networks (NGN) and many
Wireless Networks. Where there is a mandate
to perform Lawful Interception in any or all of
these networks, the first questions are how and
where to access the data.
IPIS offers a wide variety of possibilities to gain
access to and manage the flow of the
intercepted data from the networks.

IP Interception System

These include:
•
•
•
•
•

Taps
SPAN Ports
Devices with integrated LI functions
Data Collectors
Load balancing techniques, including IP
Application and Aggregation switching
• Interface/Protocol Mediation
Taps

Network Taps are used to connect to different
physical signals in an unobtrusive manner.
They are available for electrical and optical
lines for different transmission speeds.

Figure 2. IP Tap

SPAN Ports

In most network switches, a SPAN or mirroring
Port can be configured to copy the traffic of a
single or of multiple switch ports. Also
complete VLANs can be mirrored. However,
over-subscription of SPAN Ports can lead to a
loss of data.

Figure 3. SPAN Port

Integrated LI Function

Due to the evolving requirements of Lawful
Interception in IP networks, leading Internet
Switch and Router manufacturers have started
development to integrate an LI Function
directly into their devices.

Figure 4. Integrated LI function

Advantages:
• More security as only the targeted data
leaves the network
• No additional components within the
network

Page 3

Data Collectors

A Data Collector is a device used to intercept
data from IP based networks, most notably the
Internet.
They come in many forms but generally
operate by passively tapping the traffic on a
communications link and filtering an
unobtrusive copy of the data for desired
content. Only the filtered data is forwarded to
the LEA.

Figure 5. Data Collector

Advantages:
• Independence from other network
components
• High data output rates

Its purpose is to mediate requests for
intercepted content by authorised entities and
convert them into commands that are
understood by the various Data Collector
implementations and integrated LI functions in
the networks. It must also understand the
delivery protocols and mechanisms of the Data
Collectors and the integrated LI functions and
convert the intercepted data into a form
suitable for delivery to one or more Law
Enforcement Agencies.

Marking Terminals
Marking Terminals connect to the Mediation
Device and are used by Operators to mark parts
of the Internet traffic for interception by setting
or defining targets/triggers.

Load Balancing Techniques

Load Balancers can aggregate Ethernet based
signals and distribute them to multiple Data
Collectors based on load balancing and/or
traffic filtering schemes. The Load Balancer
ensures that data, which belongs to a unique
session, is forwarded to the same connected
Data Collector. In addition to aggregation and
load balancing, pre-filtering of traffic can be
performed based on an IP protocol and port
qualifier (e.g. protocol TCP with port 25).

Interface/Protocol Mediation

With special components like Routers,
transport protocols (e.g. Frame Relay, HDLC,
ATM) can be removed. In addition, the IP traffic
can be mediated from various electrical or
optical transmission media (e.g. E3/T3, STM1/OC-3, STM-4/OC-12) to Ethernet connections.

Mediation Device
The Mediation Device sits between the Data
Collectors and/or the integrated LI functions on
the network side and the LEMFs or Monitoring
Centers on the Law Enforcement Agencies’
side.

Figure 6. Mediation Device

IP Interception System

Figure 7. IMS – Marking Terminal

The marking process specifies identifying
aspects of Internet Traffic such as an IP
address, an email address, etc. The
targets/triggers are placed by the Mediation
Device into the Data Collectors or integrated LI
functions of the networks.

Law Enforcement Monitoring Facility (LEMF)
LEMF is the term used by ETSI to denote the
application used by the Law Enforcement
Agency to receive, analyse and archive
intercepted data. The Monitoring Center (MC)
from Siemens is such a LEMF and it is a typical
representative of a system that receives
intercepted data from the Mediation Device of
the IPIS.

Figure 8. Law Enforcement Monitoring Facility

The MC is designed with a flexible architecture
and can also be used to play the role of the
Marking Terminal where this is allowed under a
country’s LI laws. It can receive and process
Page 4

intercepted data from the Internet as well as
from PSTN, Mobile, 3G and NGN networks.
GPRS and UMTS networks
In GPRS and UMTS networks, subscribers can
be marked for monitoring of IP traffic by IMS
systems. The Intercept Related Information
(HI2) is transmitted via the IMS system to the
LEMF while the Call Content (HI3) is
transmitted directly from the appropriate
network element to the LEMF. These
transmissions are IP connections which can be
based on various transport networks (e.g.
Ethernet, ISDN, X.25).
For marked GPRS and UMTS subscribers, the
whole IP traffic is intercepted and forwarded to
the LEMF, regardless of the IP application used
(Web, Mail, Chat, etc.). This traffic does not
need to pass through the Mediation Device.

IP Interception System

The Challenge of Rapid Evolution
No network has evolved as far and as fast as
the Internet. Its constant change presents
continuous challenges to the LI technology
developers
to
keep
pace
with
the
communications applications being used in the
Internet. As an example, the use of VoIP is
spreading rapidly and presented its own
challenges to LI technology. VoIP interception
is now supported in the IPIS and MC.
Another evolution of the Internet is towards
broadband and the consequent increase in
amounts of data that the LEA must manage.
The Siemens VDR group is proactive and
anticipatory in its analysis and development of
technologies and architectures to address the
constant change in Internet applications and
mass data management. This is reflected in the
range of protocols supported and the various
load-balancing and data segregation techniques employed in the Siemens solutions.

Active On Air GSM: GSM-XPZ – Overview

Designed as a tactical tool for law enforcement, Government agencies and the
Military, the GSM-XP family of GSM active interception solutions have proven to
be a global hit with proven success in the field.
MMI is proud now to provide preliminary specifications for its next generation
solution. Based on commercial base-station technology this offers a quantum leap
in mobile acquisition rate, higher transmit power, operational ranges and for the
first time simultaneous operation on multiple networks and simultaneous servicing
of multiple targets.

5

A range of products will be available targeted to provide an optimal solution for
different mission scenarios. Key features include:
• Up to 50 Watts output power on 2 simultaneous channels
• Up to 4 simultaneous channels, allowing emulation of
- 4 broadcast channels on four different networks
• Dual band solutions covering 900/1800 or 850/1900 MHz and for the first time
• a world box providing 850/900/1800/1900MHz capability
• Real time monitoring and intercept of up to 4 simultaneous calls
• Integrated antenna switch on the vehicle models
• Capability to service multiple targets – up to 7 targets per carrier
• Ruggedised carry-case
• Multiple form factors to cover different operational scenarios

- 4 broadcast channels on one network

Model Variants
Three variants will be available:
• GSM-XPZ-PV (Vehicle model )
• GSM-XPZ-HP (Highly Portable model)

GSM-XPZ-PV: The vehicle model is designed for customers with an ‘in-country’
requirement, i.e. operation within their own borders. The system may require a
vehicle installation which will be performed in-country by qualified MMI
representatives.
The nature of the installation allows the system to transmit up to 50 Watts which
when added to the improved receive sensitivity and channel equalisation
dramatically extends the range. In addition the system will support multiple
channels simultaneously to a maximum of 4 channels within the unit. The PV
system is supplied with a bench top power supply to allow normal use when not
installed into a vehicle.

5

GSM-XPZ-HP: A new model variant this is designed for customers who wish to
operate discretely close to the target. Packaged into a small case, such as a
briefcase, the system can be easily used in public places without alerting targets.
In addition the system will support multiple channels simultaneously to a
maximum of 2 channels within the unit. The highly portable variant will be able to
transmit up to 250mW in 2 channels configured either as 900/1800 or 850/1900
variants. The antennas will be integrated with there an option to add an external
Power Pack to increase transmitted RF power.

Control Options
To provide users with maximum flexibility a range of control options is available;
direct Ethernet connection to the controlling laptop; wireless connection using a
suitably enabled device e.g. PDA, Laptop etc. In this mode multiple users will be
able to connect and view the following information over a secure connection:

5

• Target Identification – included as standard
• Voice Intercept (only available on PV variant)
• SMS Intercept
• Direction Finding support
• Service Denial

The operator will be able to adapt the Graphical User Interface (GUI) to display the
key information. The GUI will build on the familiarity of the existing GSM-XP to
allow both novice and experienced users the control to easily simultaneously
operate 4 basestations.
To enhance security, mission data is stored on an external memory device. This
can be easily switched between multiple systems, or used to examine mission
data offline on a separate PC or on the GSM-XPZ itself. This also allows for
protection of mission data, should the system have to be loaned to other
organisations or returned to MMI. All events as per current GSM-XP operation will
be time stamped and logged in a mission file along with intercepted Voice/SMS
data. To maintain the integrity of the data the mission files cannot be edited or
recorded voice replayed without using MMI software.

• Bubble mode

Operational Modes
Research & Release Allows phones from up to 4 networks to simultaneously
attach to the GSM-XPZ enabling their IMSI / IMEI to be
logged. Once logged, they are released back to the real
network - the most covert operational mode.
Research & Lock

Locks selected target phones to the GSM-XP BTS Ping
Mode Clones the selected BTS exactly including LAC. A
much quicker and more efficient way of capturing mobiles
as it removes the overheads associated with a location
update – the least covert operational mode.

Bubble Mode

Unless otherwise specified all phones registering to the
system will be locked to the system thus creating a bubble
of phones restricted from accessing the real networks.

Service Denial to all Hostiles
Sends a service denial message to all
phones, potential hostiles, that prevents them from
rejoining a real network.
Exclusive Network

Allows friendly phones to use the XPZ as a means to
covertly contact other operatives. Calls made in this way do
not use the real network and are therefore secure.

5

Target Mobile Actions
Overt Call

Allows operator to call a target phone and optionally
converse.

Blind Call

Active On Air GSM: GSM Mobile Tracer & Locator
(GSM-MTL3)

Description
The GSM-MTL3 enables reception of IMSI and IMEI from mobile phones within its
reception area. The device is applicable to all GSM networks of the world.
Additionally, in connection with the Mobile Finder GSM-MF, the GSM-MTL3
version provides pinpoint localization of mobile phones. Interferences with public
networks are generally avoided through complete implementation of the GSM
protocol and a specific processing. A preceding automatic network analysis sets
up ideal adjustment of the system and, thus, ensures uncomplicated operation of
the GSM-MTL3.
By means of an optional Portable Analyzer GSM-PA (PDA with Bluetooth
measuring mobile phone), the concealed remote analysis is also possible in the
near of target mobile phone. Thus, the time-consuming manual analysis and
adjustment of the network structure will not be necessary.

Operation of GSM-MTL3 occurs through a wireless control and administration unit
via HF transmission path (also with optional battery pack.)

CONFIDENTIAL

GSM On Air, Passive & Semi Active / GSM Locating

According to special demands, a more extensive network analysis and manual
processing of GSM parameters may be conducted as well.

Operating modes are as follows:
• IMEI / IMSI are read out; telephone is released into real network; another logon to the GSM-MTL3 will only be possible, if LAC is changed
• IMEI / IMSI are read out; telephone is released into real network, but cannot be
back posted into real network, i.e. mobile phone can be locked by GSM-MTL3
• GSM-MTL3 holds onto a certain mobile phone; communication is prevented on
purpose; this operation remains unperceivable for mobile phone
• GSM-MTL3 holds onto a certain mobile phone; after establishing silent call,
localization can be carried out by means of the GSM-MF
Collected data will be stored in a SQL data base within the control and
administration unit. The data can be analyzed offline and exported to other
applications.

Active On Air UMTS: 3G-FD Overview

The introduction of the next or 3rd Generation mobile means the criminal/terrorist
is now able to communicate securely, safe in the knowledge he is highly unlikely
to be intercepted. The accelerated global take-up of this service now presents a
major security threat. The 3G-FD, a complementary product to the GSM-XPZ,
significantly extends the capabilities of MMI’s portfolio of 3G products. Using the
3G-FD, it will be possible for the first time to acquire the identity of a UMTS (3G)
mobile phone, natively in 3G.
Building on the impressive capabilities of MMI’s current product range, the 3G-FD
will support working in tandem with the GSM-XPZ, where a single GUI will allow
control of both systems. This will allow a user to simultaneously acquire identities
of both GSM and 3G phones and to display this and other information in a realtime converged database.
When working in tandem with a GSM-XPZ it is possible to acquire a phone in 3G
and then force the target mobile to move onto the GSM-XPZ cell and
simultaneously setup a Blind Call. Once this has been done, all the features
available on the XPZ can be used on the phone. The MMI technology uses
standard 3GPP techniques to achieve this function and therefore has full control
over the target mobile phone during handover from 3G to 2G.

A range of products will be available targeted to provide an optimal solution for
different mission scenarios.

General Description

The device provides 50 reception channels for selection of an unassigned
frequency. The wide range of its reception dynamics (-100 dBm to +7 dBm)
ensures localization of both adjacent and distant mobile phones. An especially
designed aerial enables systematic direction detection and, thus, a rapid approach
to the sought mobile phone.

GSM On Air, Passive & Semi Active / GSM Locating

In connection with the GSM mobile tracer & locator (GSM-MTL3), the GSM
mobile finder (GSM-MF) enables pinpoint localization of mobile phones.

The compact design of the device ensures concealed operation.
Absolute reception field strength of the respective channel is shown on a display
(1 dB steps).
Relative field strength is signaled through changing tone pitch or intermitted
sound.

Direction finding
Select a free traffic channel and put the mobile device into transmission mode
(e.g. silent call). This can be realized by means of the GSM Mobile Tracer &
Locator GSM-MTL 3 or any other suitable device.
Adjust the selected traffic channel on the GSM-MF and localize the target through
directing the aerial to the maximum signal level. Thereby the absolute reception
field strength will be shown on the display. Relative field strength is signaled
through changing tone pitch or intermitted sound (according to audio settings).
MODE MENU

Automatic mode (auto)
In automatic mode, the strongest audio signal or intermitted sound is constantly
synchronized on the highest reception level measured. Audio signals or
intermitted sound will decrease at lower reception levels. Therefore, optimum
position of the aerial has to be controlled constantly.
SET menu
Change of audio signal or intermitted sound is realized for one adjustable
measuring window each. If the reception level is above or below the sensitivity
level set for the measuring window, further changes of the signal will not occur.
To continue direction finding, adjust settings for the measuring window
accordingly.

CONFIDENTIAL

GSM On Air, Passive & Semi Active / GSM Locating

Manual mode (hand)
In manual mode, a reception level, which has to be within the preset range of the
measuring window, corresponds to the respective audio signal or intermitted
sound. Thus, increase and decrease in reception field strength can be discerned.

Manual adjustment of measuring window (hand)
Press the "S" key [12] to select either the medium audio signal (manual mode) or
the maximum value (automatic mode). Instead of the “S” key [12], the remote
control, which is included in the scope of delivery, may be equally used.

Automatic adjustment of measuring window (auto)
In SET menu’s automatic mode, the medium audio signal (manual mode) or the
maximum value (automatic mode) is selected automatically, when the lower or
upper limit set for the measuring window is reached.

Operator’s tasks:
1. Define optimum pulse length of Call duration (green indication) on Pingmobile phone panel, as well as length of Standby between calls (blue
indication) in order to avoid the call being put through to BS. Optimum settings
can be identified by means of the NET Monitoring mobile phone (serves as
virtual target).
2. Define optimum intervals for analysis of received messages (red indication),
with measuring time of call until reception of message and time of Start
analysis until Stop analysis.

5

Any test telephone with known IMEI, IMSI or TMSI can be used for this
procedure.
The NET-Monitoring mobile phone (optional) can also be used for easier
identification of call parameters for the Ping-mobile phone.
If the object is found within the monitored zone, search will be stopped and
identification criteria of the object such as IMSI, IMEISV and current TMSI will
appear on the display.

Note 2. Erroneous handling of the Ping-mobile phone might lead to complete
exposure of the operation of the system!

Description
The FALCON E+ system is designed and developed as a Semi Active OFF-THEAIR GSM-Monitoring system. The system provides the option of both stationary
and mobile operation

Main Features
• The system ensures monitoring of audio and data traffic within standard GSM
900/1800 networks (800/1900 on request) and deciphers A5.1 and A5.2
algorithms online
• Default configuration of the system - 8 reception channels (4 duplex channels,
monitoring of both forward and reverse conversation channels)

CONFIDENTIAL

49

GSM On Air, Passive & Semi Active / GSM Locating

The FALCON E+ system deciphers A5.1 and A5.2 ciphering algorithms online. The
system does not require the service providers SIM for operation because uses
cloning of the targets phone in real time. Therefore, all the calls made by the
target are billed into its account.

• The operator can select the required targets based on their IMSI or IMEI. Upon
selecting the targets the system acts as a virtual base station (BTS) for these
targets.
• When one of the targets initiates a call, the FALCON E+ system automatically
calculates the ciphering key and authentications parameters. These parameters
are then cloned onto another mobile phone attached to the system (up to 4).
The targets calls are now routed through the cloned mobile phones,
maintaining the same encryption and target identity.
• The system contains a database (up to 100,000 calling partners), operating in
real-time, which can be accessed corresponding to the selected search criteria
and parameters.
• Calling partners are identified according to the IMEISV, IMSI, TMSI, ISDN
number (local and international number)
• Retrieving of target IMEI/IMSI for using targets mobile number and silent call
• Registration and storage of telephone conversations, call related information,
network information and Short Message Service (SMS) to the system’s hard
disk.

Thuraya Monitoring System
1- The Thuraya Personal Satellite Communications System
The Thuraya network has been in operation since early 2001, and is currently
based on the Thuraya-2 geostationary satellite in an inclined orbit at a longitude of
approximately 44° East. The Thuraya system provides telecommunications
coverage to Europe, North, Central and some parts of Southern Africa, the Middle
East, West and Central Asia, and the Asian Subcontinent, including more than 110
countries. Using a reduced capacity Thuraya-1 satellite at 98° East, provides some
areas of the Far-East. In January 2007 the Thuraya-3 satellite was launched into
the current location of the Thuraya-1 satellite, this new satellite has extended the
coverage area of the Thuraya network to areas of Central and Eastern Russia and
the Far East, including the eastern and south-eastern areas of mainland Asia,
Japan, Taiwan, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, the Philippines and Papua New
Guinea.

6

Since its introduction, the Thuraya system has proven to be extremely popular and
exceeded the 150,000 subscriber barrier by the mid-2003, and it is estimated to
currently have in the region of 340,000 subscribers Thuraya forecast that they will
ultimately achieve 1.75 million subscribers. One of its main appeals is to people
living or traveling in the remote areas of Africa, the Middle East and Asia, where
terrestrial infrastructure is not in place. The Thuraya network is designed to
support 13,750 simultaneous telephone calls, and in some countries typical call
levels are known to exceed 2,000 calls per hour.

2- The Strategic Thuraya Monitoring System
2.1- Principles of the Strategic Thuraya Monitoring System Operation
The strategic Thuraya Monitoring System (TMS) offered by TRL is designed to
passively intercept downlinks from the Thuraya satellite at C-Band and L-Band.

6
Figure 2 – Principle of TMS Operation

An L-Band antenna receives transmissions from the network to the Thuraya
handset (MES), and a C-band antenna receives transmissions from the Thuraya
handset to the network via the satellite.
The new system is designed to provide full duplex call interception and recording
for all calls passing through a cluster of seven spotbeams centered on the
geographical location of the installed system. It may be possible to perform duplex
call intercept on other nearby spotbeams, but this cannot be guaranteed due to
frequency reuse implemented on the Thuraya network at L-Band.
Additionally, with the inclusion of the optional Transportable Remote L-Band
Monitoring System, all calls passing through an additional cluster of seven
spotbeams centered on the geographical position of the remote system, may be
intercepted and recorded.

Where the system is able to perform C- and L-Band monitoring of a given
spotbeam, the following data is recorded by the system for every call:
• Date and time of the call
• A 4 or 5 digit subset of the IMSI of the MES
• The GPS position of the MES
• The telephone number dialled by the MES (in Mobile Originated calls only)
• The TMSI of the MES
• The Ciphering Key Sequence Number
• The RAND
• The SRES
• The Encryption Algorithm implement on the call
• The system also produces a computer file of the call that was recorded; this file
is available for offline analysis

CONFIDENTIAL

Satellite Monitoring Systems

In addition to the call intercept, the strategic TMS has the capability to monitor call
activity for all spotbeams transmitted by the Thuraya satellite, by receiving the Cband signaling information. The proposed system has the capacity to monitor 25
such spotbeams.

Figure 3 – Information Available from an Intercepted Call before Encryption is Started

6

Where the system is only able to perform C-band monitoring of a given spotbeam,
the following data is recorded by the system for every call:
• Date and time of call
• A 4 or 5 digit subset of the IMSI of the MES
• The GPS position of the MES
• The telephone number dialled by the MES (in Mobile Originated calls only)

Figure 4 – Information Received from C-Band Monitoring

CONFIDENTIAL

5

Satellite Monitoring Systems

For C-Band only monitoring, the call cannot be intercepted, and therefore no
recording file is generated.

2.2- Decryption
TRL has now identified, tested and verified the functionality of a Thuraya
Cryptanalysis and Decryption device provided by a third-party company. This
company is a proven supplier of passive GSM monitoring systems including A5/2
cryptanalysis and decryption. The Thuraya cryptanalysis and decryption unit is their
complete solution, developed as a result of determining the Thuraya encryption
algorithm and developing their existing GSM cryptanalysis product to process the
Thuraya traffic.
This solution when connected to the Strategic Thuraya Monitoring System
provides the capability for the play-back of audio voice calls and the display of the
SMS, fax and data sessions.
2.2.1- Additional Functionality Available with a Cryptanalysis Solution
With the Thuraya cryptanalysis and decryption solution integrated with the
strategic TMS, the following additional information becomes available from calls
intercepted in a full duplex C and L-band monitoring system:
• Human Comprehensible Call Content. This would include live and archived
stereo audio playback of voice calls, and presentation of decoded SMS and fax.
Additionally, a range of commercial data protocols would also be supported for
decoding data transmitted over the Thuraya network.
• MES IMEI. The IMEI of the MES would be recorded, significantly enhancing
the ability to identify and track particular Thuraya terminals.
• Calling Line Identity Presentation (CLIP). The telephone number of call
originator would be available on some calls. In particular, the telephone number
of the land-line in fixed originated calls, and the telephone number of both
parties in a Thuraya terminal to terminal call would become available.

6

2.3- A Typical Strategic Thuraya Monitoring System
A typical TMS system would include:
• Full duplex interception of Thuraya calls for terminals located within the same
spotbeam as the monitoring system, and up to 6 spotbeams immediately
adjacent to that central spotbeam
• Antenna system, including a 9.3m C-Band antenna and demodulator subsystem
for monitoring of up to 1088 simultaneous calls in the area covered by the main
installation – including GPS co-ordinates of mobile terminals
• Analysis subsystem, complete with 6 server computers and 8 analysis
workstations complete with TMS analysis software
• Full Operator, Administrator and Maintainer training programs, held both at TRL
and at the customer’s site if required
• Comprehensive operation and support documentation
• Full warranty for the first year
• The option of a Remote L-Band Unit, to extend the interception coverage of the
monitoring system, to another group of up to 7 spotbeams anywhere within the
Thuraya coverage

Cryptographic and Cryptanalysis technology is subject to export control by the
governments of many Western countries, including the United Kingdom. Upon
development of a GMR-1 cryptanalysis solution, any European or North American
developer would be obliged to apply to their respective governments for
permission to export the solution.

The demodulator subsystem receives the satellite signals from the RF/IF
subsystem at IF, and demodulates them. It includes the following:
• Demodulator Cards. A sufficient number of demodulator cards will be supplied
in order to perform dual C- and L-band monitoring and call intercept of all traffic
on up to seven spotbeams surrounding the monitoring station, as well as Cband only monitoring for at least 10 other spotbeams. If the optional Remote LBand Monitoring System is also ordered, then the strategic system will be
fitted with additional demodulator cards to provide C-band monitoring and call
intercept for the spotbeams monitored by the remote system. The
demodulator cards are fitted in to card racks, each housing 12 cards.
• Ethernet Switch
• Uninterruptible Power Supply
All components of the Demodulator Subsystem are supplied installed in a 19” rack
cabinet.

2.3.3- Analysis Subsystem
The analysis subsystem configures the demodulator subsystem according to the
User’s operational requirements. It receives the satellite signals from the
Demodulator subsystem via an Ethernet network, and stores them in the server
computers. The analysis software performs decoding and de-multiplexing of the
received signals and interprets them providing the User with information about the
traffic on the Thuraya network as described in Section X2.1X. The software
includes a geographical mapping interface based on the ESRI standard ArcGIS
software, and displays the positions of the MESs making calls on the Thuraya
network, as well as information related to the available spotbeams on a map.

It is assumed that suitable buildings, civil works and electrical power is to be
provided by the customer, and therefore is not included within the scope of this
proposal.
Training is provided in the administration, operation and maintenance of the
system both at TRL facilities, and at the customer site upon completion of the
system installation.

The TMS has a modular design allowing all aspects to be scaled to meet customer
requirements.
Remote L-Band Thuraya Monitoring Expansion
A Remote L-Band Thuraya Monitoring System (TMS) expands upon the amount of
spotbeams that a strategic TMS can provide full duplex call intercept for.

CONFIDENTIAL

Satellite Monitoring Systems

The strategic TMS is supplied with a full spares pack to reduce potential system
downtime in the event of a component failure.

6
Figure 8 – Map of the Thuraya Spotbeam Structure

The strategic TMS can provide full duplex monitoring for a cluster of up to seven
spotbeams centered on its geographical location. The addition of a Remote L-Band
TMS can extend this coverage to another cluster of up to seven spotbeams
anywhere within the coverage area of the Thuraya satellite.
The Remote L-band TMS should be connected to the strategic TMS via an ‘always
on’ connection, such as a Leased Line, WAN, or satellite link (e.g. VSAT). In this
way the Remote L-band TMS acts in a similar way to the L-band part of the
strategic TMS. Information is passed across the remote link to ensure that the
interceptions of two monitoring systems are synchronized. TRL recommend the
use of a VSAT link for remote areas, and can offer this as part of a ‘turnkey’
solution if required.
The Remote L-band TMS comprises the following components:

Rack Mount Indoor Equipment
• L-band Downconverter
• 12 Demodulator Cards are supplied as standard, in most cases this will enable
L-band monitoring and call intercept of all traffic on the seven spotbeams
surrounding the remote monitoring station. The demodulator cards are fitted

4- The Tactical Thuraya Monitoring System
The tactical Thuraya Monitoring System operates in the same way as the strategic
system, except that it only receives L-Band signals. In order for it to be able to
intercept both side of a duplex call, as well as receiving the L-Band satellite
downlink to the Thuraya terminal, it also receives the L-band uplink from the target
terminal via radio line-of-sight.
The tactical system will intercept all of the same information available from a
strategic system, but only for terminals with its radio line-of-sight. The range of
the system can vary from up to 10 km in clear terrain and from an advantageous
monitoring point, to as little as a few hundred meters in dense urban areas or
inside buildings.
The tactical TMS comprises the following components:
• Flat Plate L-Band Satellite Downlink Antenna
• Flat Plate L-Band Target Downlink Antenna
• RF Cables
• Tactical TMS Chassis fitted with 6 Demodulator Cards, Ethernet Switch Card,
IF/FRU Card, and a Dual Downconverter card

Marlin Portable Monitoring Unit
Overview
Marlin is a rapidly deployable system for the monitoring of calls made across the
Inmarsat and Thuraya satellite systems. The call intercept is invisible to both the
user and the satellite
network.
Marlin enables traffic
between the mobile
terminal and the
satellite
to
be
monitored in a line
of sight operation,
within radio range of
the target.
Control
of
the
system is via an
intuitive
windows
based GUI. Incoming
calls are displayed in
real-time, and voice
is played via a laptop computer, with each side of the call played back on either
channel of the stereo output. Software to decode and display a number of fax and
data protocols is included with the GUI.

6

Information relating to the identification of called and calling parties is recorded,
along with the geographical location (depending on service type and network).
Physical Description
The Marlin Portable Monitoring System comprises:
• Laptop
• Satellite and Target Antennae
• Marlin Portable Monitoring Unit
• Power Supply
These are supplied in travel cases for easy transport.

Each card sits horizontally and plugs into the unit from the front, allowing easy
replacement of individual cards. A backplane provides power and signal distribution
within the unit, along with accommodating an Ethernet Switch and Frequency
Reference.

Technical Description
The Demodulator Card includes the following:
• Wideband High Speed ADC
• Digital Down-Converter
• Digital Signal Processor
• Ethernet Interface
The Demodulator Card accepts an instantaneous bandwidth of 34MHz, centered
around 72MHz. The signal is filtered for image rejection, and then digitized by a
high-speed analog-to-digital converter. Frequency-tuning is performed by a digital
down converter (DDC). The resultant base-band signals are filtered by a
programmable digital filter and DMA’d directly to the DSP for demodulation. The
demodulated data is output via the Ethernet Interface.
The Dual Down Converter Card takes L-band input from the Satellite and Target
antennas, and down-converts to the 72MHz required by the demodulator cards.
Power is supplied to the antenna LNAs via the same connection, allowing rapid
deployment. It features variable attenuation to accommodate the wide range of
signal conditions experienced in the tactical environment.

The Ethernet Switch provides 4 10/100BaseT auto-negotiating Ethernet ports. Two
of the ports connect internally to the Demodulator Cards. The remaining two ports
are connected to RJ-45 connectors on the front of the unit. One allows connection
to the laptop required for control of the Marlin. The other is an expansion port. This
allows a second unit to be ‘daisy chained’, so that both units may be controlled
from a single laptop, or for the connection of compatible accessories.

CONFIDENTIAL

The backplane provides a 10 MHz reference and IF input signal to each of the
Demodulator Cards. The 10MHz frequency reference is derived from a
temperature compensated crystal oscillator with a stability of 1ppm.

Inmarsat Monitoring System

1- Introduction
1.1- General
This Proposal describes a basic Inmarsat monitoring system that provides
automated interception and recording of selected Inmarsat calls within a single
Ocean Region. The system is designed to be expanded very easily, or tailored to
specific customer requirements as desired.
The Proposal should be read in conjunction with any attached TRL Technology Ltd
(TRL) Commercial Letter.

1.2 Principles of IMS Operation
The Inmarsat series of satellites provide world-wide communications capability
through a number of geostationary satellites, strategically located to provide
overlapping coverage of the earth’s surface to latitudes in excess of 80° North and
South of the equator.

6

Communication between the satellite and Mobile Earth Stations (MES) is effected
using frequencies around 1.6 GHz and 1.5 GHz for the uplink and downlink
frequencies respectively. The fixed Land Earth Stations (LES) that provide
connections to the terrestrial communications network communicate with the
satellite using frequencies around 6.4 GHz and 3.6 GHz for the uplink and downlink
frequencies. Additional channels are used for command and control/monitoring
purposes.
Satellites currently providing the service are of the Inmarsat 3 generation. The
older Inmarsat 2 series satellites used single, shaped beam antennas to optimise
coverage over their designated areas. The current Inmarsat 3 satellites use a
number of spot beams for communication with the MES which can be combined
and reconfigured from the ground for optimum performance against changing
operational needs. The IMS has been optimised to cater for spot beam operations,
whilst retaining the flexibility required to revert to Inmarsat 2 standards if
necessary.

CONFIDENTIAL

26

Satellite Monitoring Systems

Provided that the monitoring system is located within the coverage region of the
satellite, the downlink to any MES can be monitored in the 1.5 GHz band.
However, it is extremely unlikely that the corresponding uplink channel can be
monitored directly, unless the MES is physically close to the monitoring system.
MES uplink channels are therefore monitored by using the corresponding LES
downlink channel around 3.6 GHz. This downlink channel may be Right or Left
hand circularly polarised according to Inmarsat operational requirements.

Figure 0-1 Principle of IMS operation

The Inmarsat system provides world-wide communications via a number of LES,
several of which access the same satellite concurrently. A Network Control Station
(NCS) co-ordinates the various LES to ensure that communications channels are
allocated between the LES without conflict. The control channels between the
NCS and LES also pass through the satellite, and are utilised by the IMS.

1.3- Call Intercept System Overview
The TRL Inmarsat Monitoring System (IMS) is designed to intercept and record
voice, facsimile and data calls to and from selected terminals using the Inmarsat
communications system. The IMS can be extensively configured to select
terminals whose full identity is not known, or to log and/or record particular types
of call, or to record calls made to particular parts of the world or to specific
telephone numbers.

6

Voice calls may be monitored in real-time, or recovered and played back from the
system database. Facsimile and data calls may generally be displayed with the
simple viewer incorporated in the system, or exported for analysis or manipulation
by other systems or with user-specific software.
The generic system is capable of monitoring and recording Inmarsat A, B, C, D, M
and mini-M signals, including High Speed Data (HSD) signals used by B and M4
(GAN) terminals.
2- Technical Requirements
The flexibility of the IMS is such that it can be difficult for a Customer to decide on
the system configuration that best satisfies his operational needs, until he has
operated the system in his own environment. The IMS is designed to be
expanded and modified by the addition of extra hardware and software as a
Customer’s requirements change and new services become available.

2.1- Intercept functionality
The baseline system is capable of receiving Inmarsat B, C, M, and mini-M
transmissions from a single satellite, and for a single Ocean Region. This includes
high speed data traffic from Inmarsat B and M4 terminals. Inmarsat A reception is
also possible with this system, although decoding of A facsimiles requires an
additional, and optional, software add-on.
CONFIDENTIAL

27

Satellite Monitoring Systems

This technical proposal describes a basic, balanced Inmarsat monitoring system
that can form the basis for more complex systems tailored to a Customer’s
specific requirements.

The basic system is to capture and record up to ten simultaneous duplex
communications with Inmarsat terminals against criteria selected by the users
(IMS).
The basic system provides three workstations for signal analysis of recorded
traffic, and for monitoring voice traffic “live”.

2.2- Location of equipment
It is assumed that all the equipment will be located together at a single site.
A set of RF equipment, comprising antennas and other necessary hardware, must
be located such that the length of cable between the antennas and the system
rack does not exceed 80 metres, and the Ethernet cabling between the racks and
computers does not exceed 100 metres.

2.3- Implementation
The offer is for the provision of a turnkey baseline system to be installed by TRL
personnel at the Customer’s nominated site, complete with all necessary training,
handbooks and support to enable the end users to operate and maintain the
equipment. TRL will provide all the electronic equipment and antenna facilities
required for the system.

6

The Customer must provide a suitable site with accommodation and furniture for
the equipment, and suitable power supplies to operate the equipment and
antennas.

CONFIDENTIAL

28

Satellite Monitoring Systems

It is assumed that access to Customer’s sites is restricted. TRL will co-operate
with the Customer to utilise cleared/approved sub-contractors to perform the
antenna civil works. The antennas and equipment rack will be installed by TRL
technicians and subcontractors. All necessary security passes and clearances shall
be provided by the Customer.

Using these sophisticated analysis algorithms and advanced COMINT signal
processing, experts can also derive meaningful results for difficult signal scenarios
providing a basis for swift and reliable decision-making.

Signal Detection and Classification
Our
software
allows
signal
detection and classification to be
performed largely automatically.
First, the program generates a
symbolic representation of the
broadband
signal.
Individual
emitters are detected by the
system and described as segments
in the time-frequency domain. The
meta data, too, are automatically
added to the segments. The result
is a list of emitters with all the
important technical parameters,
such as signals, spectrums, and
modulation types, and other meta
data.
Needless to say these data are
decisive to further processing. If
adequately
conditioned,
they
provide an invaluable source of
information. And
secure
the
necessary knowledge advantage.

Virtual Devices and PC-Based Architecture
Traditionally, conventional technical equipment for signal processing has
comprised individual devices or dedicated hardware modules based on VXI
technology, for example. This technology was tried, tested, and reliable, but also
bulky, inflexible, and costly – by no means ideal.
So we have consciously sought new directions in the development of our
equipment. Today, the virtual devices are software modules which boast the
functions of hardware devices but run on commercially available PCs without any
specialized hardware.
The advantages to you:
• More flexibility
• Improved integration into server-based IT systems
• Considerable cost savings
By separating the processor and software lifecycles no huge investment is ever
needed to keep you equipment state of the art. Putting you in control of your
future.

Tactical Portable Spectrum Monitoring System: MRMS
3000
The radio monitoring & analysis system MRMS 3000 has been developed for
operational services. It has got a modular set-up and is used for swift radio
monitoring within a frequency range from 25 MHz to 3 GHz.
Rapid FFT analysis allows of high-speed search run of ca. 20 MHz/s. Downstream
monitoring receivers enable listening-in and recording of up to four signals
simultaneously. Minimum response time between start of search run and
activation of monitoring receiver is ca. one second.
By adding another search receiver, the frequency band can be extended to the 100
kHz to 25 MHZ range. Within this range, the search run speed is only 45 steps/s
(i.e. step size of 12.5 kHz at 562.5 search run speed).

The system consists of:
• one broadband and narrow band receiver each
• up to 4 monitoring receivers
• a software-based demodulator, decoder and analyser
• a control processor
• aerial units (corresponding to respective frequency range)

The FinFisher Project – Function and Purpose
In essence, it is an aggressive IT hacking component. It utilizes and incorporates
Black Hat Hacking tactics to enable Intelligence Agencies to be able to gather information from target systems that would otherwise be extremely difficult to obtain legally.
The FinFisher Project operates on the understanding that there is a need for “authorized” Agencies to obtain information, using such methods, as they need to
be pro-active against the strategies and tactics employed by their Targets. They
can then alert the appropriate Law Enforcement or Military units and organizations within their country to intercept and prevent an incident, as opposed to
reacting after.
The System has also been developed with operational simplicity in mind, so that
Intelligence operators require the minimum of technical ability and skill when using the tactical components within the FinFisher Project.
The FinFisher Project is scalable, thus becoming more complex in capability and
operation as the objectives of the user become more complex, and their knowledge and understanding of the Systems they are attacking become more advanced.

8

Appropriate Note
The FinFisher System has been developed to assist Intelligence Agencies obtain
information from civilian individuals and groups. It is not intended, or has it been
tested, to see if it has the capability to break into advanced complex government
or military security systems with secret, or above security, classification.
Also, while every effort has been made to ensure the FinFisher Project can get
past known Anti-Virus and Anti-Spyware Products and local Firewalls and Security, no guarantees are given in this area as these products are continuously being
developed on a daily basis.
Also no guarantees can be given as to the effect these products have on the target's PC. They are designed to remove information as discreetly and covertly as
possible. But each system can react differently depending on settings, applications and configurations, so the result is unknown.

Recommended Additional Components
FinFisher 6 – Finfly Download Proxy
The FinFisher FinFly Download Proxy is a HTTP proxy that is able to modify executable files while they are being downloaded by 1 or multiple clients.
The proxy offers 2 options:
•
•

Replace executable files
Modify executable files

In the modification progress, the original executable is downloaded, merged with
a local executable file and sent to the client.
On execution of the modified executable on the client side, the appended executable gets executed first before the original executable is restored and executed so it will pass all internal checksums verifications.

Usage: The FinFly Download Proxy can be used for trojan horse infection. This
can be single or multiple clients (by IP addresses) or all participants of the network that are routed through the HTTP proxy.
Required Operating System: Linux / BSD (Windows Version on request)

FinFly Download Proxy will be ready in March 2008.

Audio Surveillance Network
1 Product Description
Audio Surveillance Network (ASN) is a complete solution for law enforcement
agencies to collect, transmit, store and analyze audio coming from distant targets
at a centralized location. ASN consists of both hardware and software elements
suitable for building a countrywide audio surveillance system, or to conduct
standalone tactical operations. A typical ASN layout consists of various target
locations, remote location sites, a central headquarters and a set of observer
terminals.

Audio is captured form a target location by audio transmitters containing tiny
microphones, and transferred to the remote location site over a telephone line.
Usually, a remote location site exists near a location exchange. It contains a large
bank of receivers to collect audio from various target locations. The received audio
channels are digitized and stored in a remote location server.

CONFIDENTIAL

The audio data is sent to the headquarters using a DSL or E1 link. The
headquarters stores digital audio coming from a number of remote locations in a
huge database. Observer terminals access the headquarters database using
custom written audio surveillance software. An ActiveX based audio player offers
audio analysis capability and on-line comment tag submission to the observers.
ASN is the only system of its kind that offers real-time audio surveillance from a
number of distant targets from beginning to end.

2 System Elements
The Following system elements have been developed to build an ASN.
Target Location
- Xad Audio Transmitter (XTL-ATx)
Remote Location Site
- Xad Audio Receiver (XKL-ARx)
- Xad Audio Acquisition Platform (XRL-ACQ)
- Xad Remote Location Server (XRL-SER)
- Xad Remote Location Software (XRL-SW)

10

Headquarters
- Xad Headquarter server (XHQ-SER)
- Xad Headquarter Software (XHQ-SW)
Audio Transmitters (XRL-ATx)
Audio is collected from the target location using Audio Transmitters (XTL-ATx).
Each transmitter contains a high gain, sensitive microphone, which is installed on
the target line irrespective of the location and polarity. The installation does not
interfere with the normal operation of telephone equipment. XTL-ATx comes in
two versions – XRL-ATP works with standard POTS, while XRL-ATA is designed
for ADSL enabled telephone lines. For major operations, up to four XRL-ATx units
can be deployed per target. A user can remotely activate the desired XRL-ATx
leaving the others in standby mode.
Each XRL-ATx has built-in intelligence to sense the line status and start-stop its
operation independent of the user intervention. Salient features of an XRL-ATx are
listed below:
Small size 16 x 9 mm
Low current consumption (active 4mA, standby 4μA
High gain microphone 48 dB
Polarity free installation
Seamless operations on PSTN and ADSL enabled lines
Automatic start-stop and mute functions
Choice of 4 transmitters per line

Audio Receiver (XRLS-ARx)
Audio Receiver (XRLS-ARx) is a very low noise state-of-the-art receiver to extract
clear audio signals from noisy telephone lines at a distance of 5 Km from the target
location. XRLS-ARx outputs receive audio to the headquarters and phono sockets.
There are manual control buttons on the XRLS-ARx to switch between multitransmitter installations or mute all, if required. XRLS-ARx also provides a digital
interface which is used to control XRLS-ARx from the headquarters’ software.
Main features of XRLS-ARx are listed below:
Transparent operations on PSTN and ADSL enabled lines
Standalone and network operation
Automatic voltage control
Manual button control for standalone operations

The Audio Acquisition Platform (XRLS-ACQ) is a 1U height 19 inch rack mount unit.
It consists of a custom built PCB to acquire, digitize and transfer 28 audio channels
to a Remote Location Server (XRLS-SER).

10

ACQ uses four 8-bit analog to digital converters to digitize the audio channels. The
digital audio samples are buffered before sending them to XRLS-SER using a USB
2.0 interface. Main features of the XRLS-ACQ platform are listed below:
-

19 inch rack mountable casing
Parallel A/D conversion of 28 analog audio channels
64KB buffer memory to ensure data continuity
High speed data transfer using USB2 interface
Integrated interface for audio and transmitter control using RJ45 ports

Xad Remote Location Server (XRLS-SER)
The Remote Location Server (XRLS-SER) is a powerful machine built with 64 bit
AMD 2.0GHz dual core processor and Linux operating system. The industrial PC
casing with front and rear fan support provides ruggedness to operate in extreme
temperatures expected at a remote location site. The remote location server is
lockable at the front providing extra security to the system.

Remote Location Server Software (XRLS-SW)
The remote location server software (XRLS-SW) runs on XRLS-SER and controls
the main functionality of a remote location site. It is written in C++ under a Linux
operating system. For security reasons, a user interface has not been built in the
remote location software. The remote location operator uses a console window to
execute commands for each task. Main features of XRLS-SW are listed below:
-

Command line interface for added security and reliability
Security database installation without user interaction
Built under Linux for easy integration, faster speed and stability
Database storage for systematic archiving of audio streams
Automatic audio acquisition and uploading according to the headquarters’
schedule
Thread based real-time audio encoding and uploading

10

Transmission Hardware
The requirement for transmission hardware (E1 routers, DSL and related
components) may differ in each case. Depending upon the requirement, we can
specify the transmission hardware to be used in an ASN.

Headquarter Server Software (XHQ-SW)
The headquarter server software (XHQ-SW) provides the main control of the ASN.
XHQ-SW software is accessed by the Microsoft Internet Explorer through a Webbased environment. The complex system information remains hidden behind a
user friendly graphical user interface (GUI).
CONFIDENTIAL

Room Monitoring

Headquarter Servers (XHQ-SER)
The HQ is the main control center of the ASN. It is connected to remote location
sites in a star network topology. The XHQ-SER comprises two database servers, a
storage server, and an application server. The database servers are similar in
specification to XRLS servers. The storage configuration is tailored according to the
requirements. To build redundancy, the database servers are connected to the
storage server in cluster configuration. The application server is an apache based
server, which hosts web-based HQ server software. It allows the observer
terminal to access the huge audio database.

All the software pages are interconnected. A user can navigate across them using
a dynamic menu bar. The menu items vary according to the user access privileges.
The main features of the XHQ-SF are listed below:

PSTN Module – Remote set-up
The PSTN module provides a link from the listening post to the monitoring
site. One PSTN module is needed at the monitoring site and one at the
listening post. The PSTN module can handle 2 lines simultaneously and
transfers both the audio from the transmitter and the remote control
commands.
The PSTN module at the monitoring site can also be dialed up from standard
telephone equipment, including mobile phones. Access to the system is done
by means of the telephone keypad. This feature enables the operator to make
a quick control of the TX / RX / PSTN set-up.
The PSTN module is very easy to install – it is connected to the receiver via
one single cable, containing all the required signals and power.
Control Software
All facilities in the TSE 4004 system can be software controlled via a PC. The
control set-up can be provided by connecting the control PC directly to the
receiver module or to the local PSTN module at the listening post.

Wired Audio Monitoring via PSTN Lines (RFM)
(TSE 4006)

System Introduction
The room and telephone monitoring system TSE 4006 is developed by
GAMMA to allow the audio monitoring of room and telephone conversation
via standard PSTN telephone lines. The TSE 4006 is designed to operate
without interfering with the normal functions of the telephone system and to
provide the very high speech quality requirements of surveillance operatives.
Transmitters use current when operating and this normally creates a voltage
drop in the PSTN line being used. The TSE 4006 receiver is equipped with a
special circuit which replaces the current used so that there is no voltage drop
in the telephone line. This makes the TSE 4006 difficult to detect by
automatic central exchange loop current detector systems.

10

Description

CONFIDENTIAL

14

Room Monitoring

The TSE 4006 is specifically designed for covert audio surveillance operations.
The TSE 4006 has the ability to monitor a room and its telephone line by
utilizing the existing telephone system. All room and telephone conversations
can be monitored and recorded from a remote location. TSE 4006 utilizes
techniques which have not been previously used in PSTN line monitoring and
consists of two units: a front end transmitter module TSE 4006-TX and an FM
receiver combined with a line intercept amplifier TSE 4006RX.

Transmitter
The TSE 4006 transmitter module incorporates a highly sensitive microphone
coupled to a pre-amplifier with a wide dynamic range, fast acting AGC
(Automatic Gain Control), and FM-modulator. It is protected against high
voltage spikes and calling signals on the line. The TSE 4006 is available in a
variety of forms including a scrambled version TSE 4006-TXS-S or TSE 4006TXR-S.
Receiver
The TSE 4006-RX receiver is built into a strong aluminum housing containing
the FM receiver, Mixer circuitry and a line intercept amplifier with a high
impedance differential input and very high common mode rejection. This
assures that the highest possible signal to noise ratio is achieved. The built-in
mixer circuitry allows the operative to listen to either the room conversation or
the telephone conversation - or both at the same time. The receiver TSE
4006-RX is equipped with a de-scrambler module, which is capable of descrambling the signals from TSE 4006-TXS-S and TSE 4006TXR-S. Outputs
are provided for Headphones, Tape/aux., VOX switch and a 600 ohm balanced
output for re-transmission on a standard PSTN dial up line or CCITT M1020
line (leased line).
Applications

10

A hard wired audio surveillance system is more difficult to detect than a
conventional radio transmission system and is capable of giving better speech
quality. There is no “drop out” of signal, a common problem with radio
transmission systems. The TSE 4006 system incorporates some unique
features, and is specifically designed for covert operations. The transmitter is
to be installed via parallel connection with the target line and can be
concealed inside the telephone, behind the wall socket or anywhere with
direct access to the telephone line.
The TSE 4006 system is designed to work with PSTN slave lines without
amplifiers and filters.
Typical methods of deployment:
-

During new construction work
Exchanging the telephone
Hard wiring into the telephone line during covert entry
Simulated repair of the PSTN communication network

Audio Level/Line Voltage Meter
The TSE 4006-RX is fitted with an analog meter, which enables the line DC
voltage or the audio dBm level to be measured by switching between the two
modes.
Smart Vox with Noise Cancellation

Room Monitoring

VOX sensitivity can be set on the front panel. The newly developed intelligent
VOX circuitry is equipped with two LEDs for easy setting, and has the
capability to distinguish a voice from ambient background noise, increasing
the VOX reliability in noisy environments.

Dual Output
The TSE 4006-RX is fitted with 2 audio outputs; an RCA jack socket with line
level output for tape recorder and a standard 600 ohm balanced telephone line
output for re-transmission of the monitored audio via the PSTN network.
Telephone based operational set up

10
Technical Features
Fitted with CRS System
All transmitters use current when operating. A major problem for most PSTN
line parasitic transmitters is the current drawn from the PSTN line that
enables the transmitter to function.
If the transmitter draws more than approx. 6 mA, the line status changes from
on-hook to off-hook. This change in current consumption, even when less
than 6 mA, is easily detectable by counter surveillance methods and indicates
an abnormality in the line. Gamma has developed a Current Re-injection
System (CRS) to overcome these problems. The CRS system re-inserts the
current used by the TSE 4006-TX unit which avoids a voltage drop across the
target telephone line. This ensures that the targeted PSTN line is unaffected
by the presence of the TSE 4006-TX unit and makes the system difficult to
detect by conventional counter surveillance methods.
Operational Features
Adjustable Off-Hook Threshold Level
The TSE 4006-RX unit is equipped with on-hook/off-hook threshold level
adjustment at the rear of the receiver, which can be set between 10 and 40
Volts.

Activity Indicator
For ease of operation the receiver unit TSE 4006-RX is fully equipped with
LED status indicators.

Parametric Equalizer
In order to optimize the audio quality, the monitored signal is passed through
a parametric equalizer with variable boost or cut in the 100 Hz to 10 kHz
frequency range and variable Q.

Options
Standard Transmitter Module
The TSE 4006-TXS is our standard miniature transmitter with built-in
microphone.
Extended Microphone Version
On the TSE 4006-TXR transmitter the microphone is mounted on 2 metres of
cable, separate from the transmitter board. This allows the microphone to be
placed in the target room and the electronics package to be in an adjacent
room - a technique that makes it very difficult to locate the transmitter by
conventional counter surveillance methods.
British Telecom Outlet Versions
Integrated wall outlet TSE 4006-TXBT-I and External wall outlet TSE 4006TXBT-W.
Scrambled Versions TSE 4006-TXS-S and TSE 4006-TXR-R
The TSE 4006-TXS-S transmitter uses a Gamma developed, analogue-speech
protection system, which ensures the highest possible quality of retrieved
speech. A descrambler module in the TSE 4006-RX receiver is able to decode
the signals from the TSE 4006-TXS-S or TSE 4006-TXR-R.

Analytical Software
iBase for Arabic speaking Organizations
To process and analyze large quantities of data (eg. to retain and be able to query
mobile and landline billing data over longer periods of time), or to permanently
store data, the i2 database component iBase should be considered. The database
consists of two parts: iBase User and iBase Designer. The iBase User component
is required to access and manipulate information in the database and display it in
the Analytical Notebook. The iBase Designer component allows the user to design
or change the way the database is set up and how it operates. Each organization
needs only one of these ‘Designer’ components. The iBase Designer part of the
course covers the design and maintenance of the database. There will need to be
at least one person in each organization who has the technical ability to configure
and permanently maintain the database.
The advanced querying facility in iBase allows for more effective data mining and
significantly increases the analytical power of the software. There is the added
advantage of providing the organization with a database to store and access their
information easily.

11

i2’s iBase 4 does not currently operate using Arabic characters. In spite of the
work around solutions laid out below, it will still be necessary to assign an English
speaking IT expert to be the key operator or ‘super user’ for the system.

Analytical Software, Forensic & Speech Technology

Options for creating an English/Arabic iBase Database:
• Hyperlinks can be embedded into the individual database entries, which when
activated open original Arabic documents, such as operational files, charts of
police floor plans, Excel spreadsheets, PDFs, html documents, scanned
documents, etc. (Photographs can be embedded into the database proper).
• A series of symbols attached to entities indicate to non-English speaking users
that there are Arabic language documents (such as bio-data, agent reports,
files, etc.), which relate to the entity. (see below)

iBase Screen Shots

ANB can also be used as a data entry point. The analyst needs only to draw a
visual interpretation of the relationships between people and other entities to be
displayed, and the information will automatically be stored in iBase.

Why Speech Classification?
The increasing quantity of speech
signals needs an effective and high
quality means for the analysis of
audio data.
Obtaining support from an automated software tool is highly
appreciated by operators working
with the analysis of speech files.
MELANIE can help support the
operator with:
• Automated analysis of incoming
speech signals
• A means for analysis of incoming
speech signals using the results of
the MELANIE classifiers.

11

What Can Be Analysed?
MELANIE provides a software library for the classification of incoming speech
signals referring to

• Language Identification:
All incoming audio signals are classified according to the speech prevailing in the
audio files. All languages of the world can be identified as soon as training material
is available.

CONFIDENTIAL

6

Analytical Software, Forensic & Speech Technology

• Speech Detection:
The parts of audio signals containing speech are marked. For storing the incoming
signals, only those parts containing speech may be stored.

• Speaker Identification:
Speakers in incoming audio signals
can be identified. The algorithm is
independent of the spoken language,
thus a speaker can be found also
when communicating in another
language.
Training material for the speaker to
be analysed is necessary, a rejection
of unknown speakers is made.

Product Description
For these classifiers, training, testing, and automatic production can be performed.
For each application, libraries of software functions are available, together with a
standardized and open interface (CORBA).
• Training environment: Classifiers can be trained optimally for the domain of the
user. In a simple script-based training, the user can build the classifiers according
to his domain and data material.

11

• ELAMAN offers trained models for some applications, the user does not have to
train the classifier’s parameters.
• Production environment: This environment automatically classifies all incoming
audio signals using the available classifiers. A simple standardized interface is
given for the automatic production 24/24h. The production environment is available
as PC license or as site license.
The classifiers can be used via the CORBA interface. They can be integrated into
PC-based OEM applications.
Classifiers are available for the following applications:

Functionality
Speech
signals
are
often
recorded with pauses and noise
within the speech signal. This
algorithm is able to detect those
parts of a speech signal that contain speech on larger segments of audio signals.
The results are very useful to reduce the amount of data that have to be stored
and anaylsed.
Speech signals can be analysed according to the language prevailing in the speech.
For each speech signal, an overall score and
probability is estimated. In addition, these
values can also be estimated for any time
interval.
Training of Models

11
Goal

Training is performed in order to optimise the models on
the languages and channel of the application. Training

Data

The training data must be labeled according to either
speech/nonspeech or with the prevailing language. The
data must be representative and as similar as possible to
the data of the application. A minimum of one hour of data
is required for each language.

Trained Models

In case of insufficient data, trained models for a set of
languages can be provided to use the system from
scratch.

OperatingSystem
Processing Time

Recognition Rate

Available on Windows XP and Linux
• On a P4; 3GHz, 1GB RAM computer
• Classifying 10 different languages
• 1/15 of real time; i.e. a signal of 15 minutes length is
processed in one minute
The recognition rate depends on the number of languages,
on the similarities and charactistics of the languages, and
on the speech quality.

SCOOTY – Speech Classification Online and Offline
Technology
SCOOTY Overview
What can SCOOTY be used for?
SCOOTY is a speech analysis system. In a process from signal detection,
recording, processing and filtering to evaluation, SCOOTY is part of the evaluation
by analysing audio files for the following features:
• speech/non-speech detection
• language identification
The core parts of SCOOTY executing this analysis are called “classifiers”. Based
on a client / server architecture, SCOOTY provides a software environment for:
• training
• configuration
• classification
• production

11

How is SCOOTY used?
The process is the following: After classifier training and configuration, SCOOTY
produces classification results without further user intervention. Training and Test
result data as well as configuration data are stored in the data resource (a kind of
an archive) and are recalled for production.
Production results are also saved in the archive and concurrently shown on screen
to allow monitoring of progress and results.

Everybody working on speech and language is a possible user of SCOOTY
software. Typical users of the software are people working on huge amounts of
speech data coming in. This can be a university working on the structure of speech
and languages, such as dialects, accents, and language history. A benefit from the
use of SCOOTY can also be drawn by research institutes in medicine treating with
diseases in the production and perception of speech.

What is the benefit when using SCOOTY?
Using SCOOTY, large amounts of speech signals can automatically be processed
and sorted according to their characteristics.

CONFIDENTIAL

21

Analytical Software, Forensic & Speech Technology

Who uses SCOOTY?

The performance of the system depends on the training data that are fed to the
system. Speech files can be sorted according to the characteristics, giving an
indication on the spoken speech. Eventually, an indication can be given also on the
dialect, depending on the training data.
The accuracy for the classification of a language depends on the involved
languages and especially on the training material that is used for the estimation of
the classifier. Out of 1000 files for classification, usually 600 files can be classified
correctly, according to the spoken language.

Does the structure of SCOOTY fit into my environment?
The SCOOTY software is based on a client/server architecture consisting of the
following parts:
• SCOOTY client(s) – graphical user interface
• processing server – signal parameterisation and classification
• archive server – data management

11

Classifiers
How does SCOOTY use the classifiers?
SCOOTY performs the classification with
the following classifiers:
• a speech/non-speech classifier
• two language classifiers using different
algorithms estimating the probability for the
involved languages.

CONFIDENTIAL

22

Analytical Software, Forensic & Speech Technology

Each of these software parts is available as single user version or network version,
and each of them is available for different operating systems. They can be
combined freely and platformindependently via TCP/IP, so they are highly
adaptable to system and application requirements.

Furthermore, SCOOTY enhances the speech quality of the input signal to improve
the reliability of the classification results.
SCOOTY applies cascaded classifiers and the signal enhancement to the input
signal containing WAVE files. The classifiers are equipped with an extensive
parameter set. The parameters are adjusted during classifier training to gain
optimum quality of classification results.
System Configuration Examples
Example 1:
SCOOTY runs on 1 PC or notebook and is
used by 1 user.

11

Example 2:

Example 3:
SCOOTY is used by multiple users working on different tasks at different places.
Operators at place A work on classifier training and designing different SCOOTY
configurations, while other users work directly on the production results. A
network connection between places A and B is not necessary.

CONFIDENTIAL

23

Analytical Software, Forensic & Speech Technology

SCOOTY is distributed over 3 workstations connected via a network. Still it is used
by 1 user but the workstations perform different tasks, such as classifier training
and production.

Classifier Parameterization and Training
How can SCOOTY find “my” languages?
The SCOOTY classifiers are trainable to allow them to be adapted to individual
customer requirements. The results of the training process are special model data,
which are later used during classification. Best classification results are achieved
with customer training and test data.

11

SCOOTY is equipped with a complete training and test environment for the
classifiers. This covers a transcription tool to generate label files (they contain
information about whether an audio file contains speech, and if so, about the
language) and a graphical user interface for easy classifier training and testing.

Classification Process Configuration

SCOOTY allows the use of the available classifiers in different combinations:
• cascading of classifiers and signal enhancement
• exclusion of unnecessary classifiers
• use of differently parameterized classifiers
Different combinations and cascades of classifiers can be summarized to signal
flows. The following figure shows 2 valid cascades, each specially adapted to a
certain scenario:

24

Analytical Software, Forensic & Speech Technology

Is SCOOTY flexible to meet my requirements?

Production
How does SCOOTY work?
After starting the production, SCOOTY reads its input directory and processes the
input files in a hierarchical order. Each input file represents a task for SCOOTY.
SCOOTY processes them in the order of priorities. For each task, SCOOTY
produces result files and additionally displays the results on the screen. No further
user intervention is required, but the user can observe the production progress and
status.
During production, SCOOTY selects one of the configured signal flows (cascades)
for each task. The selection depends on information provided by an external
control unit. The file then runs through a cascade of classifiers assigned to the
selected signal flow. In the cascade, the file is finally analyzed. This concept allows
SCOOTY to analyze signal files from different sources.
The figure shows the data flow during the production:

A processing server coordinates the classification process. It encapsulates
classification functions in a way that they are externally available as services.

CONFIDENTIAL

25

Analytical Software, Forensic & Speech Technology

Result Retrieval and Display
How can I view and further process SCOOTY’s results?
Classification results are:
• Detected speech
• Identified languages

SCOOTY stores the results, the protocol of all activities and processed files in an
archive:
• A work log of each classification (text format)
• Label and score files of each classification (linked information in text and XML
format)
• Training and test results, model data, test results (text and XML format)
• Signal files (WAVE format)
The LogViewer is an extensive retrieval tool to recall the results from the archive.
Other result files are additionally stored in an output directory from which they can
be taken by other processes. SCOOTY provides all results for extensive statistical
computing. The archive allows the user to search for all types of data.

11

Data Management
Isn’t it difficult for me to handle all these complex data?
All information is provided with attributes, after which it can easily be searched
and sorted. SCOOTY provides a user-friendly graphical user interface for
comfortable and fast data retrieval and viewing.

CONFIDENTIAL

26

Analytical Software, Forensic & Speech Technology

Additionally, during production temporary results are displayed on screen:

A central data handling resource (the archive) is the pool for any type of
information. All relevant data appearing in the SCOOTY workflow are stored on the
archive server. The SCOOTY archive assures traceability of processes, data
consistency and cross-reference consistency. It stores:
• training, test results and model data
• configuration data
• production results

11

Further Developments
I need different information from the audio signal. Will there be more classifiers?
Currently, the following classifiers are under development:
• word spotter
• topic spotter based on sound files
• text visualisation and classification
• speaker identification
Furthermore, there will be the opportunity of text analysis of audio files.

The following list summarizes the features of SCOOTY:
• System for automatic signal classification
• Server client architecture
