Simena’s Vision of Open Networking
 Networking equipment with open source operating system
and applications.
 Proprietary hardware is still needed for performance.
 Linux based control plane using multicore processor.
 Linux prompt, not a closed CLI.
 SDK/API for developing custom applications.
 Abundance of tools/apps/protocols: Perl, HTTP/HTTPS,
SNMP, e-mail, TACACS+, Syslog, SSH, etc.
 Open specifications for adding new hardware to the system.

Open Networking in Lawful Interception (LI)

 Automating and customizing applications to create copies of
packets, distribute, and filter them.
 Being able to add new features easily:
 Parsing headers to create triggers for further analysis.
 Switching, replacing, removing, stacking VLAN/MPLS tags.
 Adding new packet filters for new protocols

 Packet de-duplication

Open Networking in Lawful Interception (LI)

 SDK/API for managing the equipment remotely from other
applications, besides using web and CLI interfaces only.
 Time synchronization and time stamping by using open
standards such as IEEE1588.
 Running key LI applications such DPI in the same
equipment.

 Providing open hardware specifications for customers to
integrate NPU/FPGA based solutions.
