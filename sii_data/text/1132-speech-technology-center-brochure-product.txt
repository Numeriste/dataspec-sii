ALL-IN-ONE
FOR THE
PROFESSIONAL

IKAR Lab working screen with analysis menu open. Each
type of analysis includes several methods and allows
fine adjustment of its settings and visualization.

IKAR Lab has been used for forensic examinations and
speech enhancement in the majority of law enforcement
departments in Russia as well as in some other
countries. It has also been used in security services of
many banks and businesses, in research, medical and
educational institutions. Over a long period of its
existence and development this system has absorbed
all the best practically useful adjustments in speech
research area.
IKAR Lab working screen with filtration menu open. In
the upper window you can see two waveforms - darker
blue one of the noisy signal, and lighter green one of the
filtered signal. In the lower window there are FFT spectra
of the source (upper red line) and the processed (lower
pink line) signals.
