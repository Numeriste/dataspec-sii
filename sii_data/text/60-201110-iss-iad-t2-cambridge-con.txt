Market trends - Identity
 “Know your enemy”

 Identification is a crucial first step in defending
the public against potential threats

 Ubiquitous mobile phone ownership
– Up to 96% in USA
– Generally personal devices

 Mobile phone SIM card gives a unique,
electronically readable personal identifier

Market trends – Mobile surveillance
 Technology is a “moving target”
– Movement from voice to data connectivity
– Machine to Machine communications (M2M)
– Evolving standards GSM to GPRS to 3G to HSPA to LTE
– White-space radio…

Market trends – Mobile surveillance
 User needs
– Smaller size units
– Fast deployment
– Scalable usage
– Covert operation
– Reduced number of unwanted phones detected

 And finally… within a budget

Market Trends – Consumer products driving innovation
 Example – femtocells are compact cellular base-stations
in your home

 High performance –when compared to a conventional base station, still
has a similar processing requirement
 Extremely compact – requires highly integrated solution
 Growth opportunity – mass market consumer product
 Investment - new architectures and technologies

Technology Trends – Software Defined Radio
 picoChip baseband processing chip
 All baseband processing requirements from
digital samples to and from RF through to
network interfacing is integrated enabling an
extremely low BOM cost
 For example, PC312 consists of a 3GPP Node B
PHY, ARM11 processor, cryptographic engine,
high speed accelerators and peripherals
 Software defined radio architecture allows
manufacturers to develop whilst specifications
are maturing and update design using software
patches

Market trends – Consumer technologies taken into other markets
 Iridium is the only truly global telecoms network
– Low Earth Orbit satellites, with low delay and no
orientation of the handset antenna

 Challenge is to create a broadband data terminal
 Solution
– Set of 7 antennas in ground terminal equipment to
track satellites moving at 8km/s whilst also adapting to
movement of the platform
– Compensation for the small received signal and the
Doppler shift caused by the very fast movement of the
satellites
– Platform based approach to design, using Software
Defined Radio architecture
– Consumer technology taken from femto-cell products

 Cambridge Consultants responsible for full system
design and implementation, from concept to product

 Commercial components and technology to
implement a “tiny base-station”
– Baseband processing from picoChip
– Programmable radio receiver from Lime
microsystems
 Cellular communication physical layer
– Reference design for GSM / GPRS
– Software upgrade to 3G
– Functions as base station and network sniffer,
for detection of background cellular conditions
