Bs3 Strategic, based on the precise and ultra-fast BS3 core
engine, is designed t o analyze millions o f incoming audio
files spotting a list of valuable targets with extremely
accurate rates, thus reducing dramatically the number of
calls required for further intelligence processing and
facilitating easy and quick speaker pursuit.

Features:

1

High Speed performance: Bs3 Strategic is able to process
up t o 1000 hours o f audio in a day (20,000 incoming calls
(-3mins) dealing with 500 targets) and execute up t o 85,wa
matches per second (fastest scoring time) with a single Core
CPU - fully scalable as the BS3 Engine can be deployed in a
multi-threadedlmulti-core environment;
Smart load distribution: BS3 Strategic is able t o handle a
multi-server deployment thus scaling the performance up
t o millions of audio files per day with monitoring of
management of the components;

I

Strong front-end capabilities: 6s3 Strategic has strong
front-end capabilities (audio validation, Automatic Voice
Activity Detector (AVAD)) t o remove artifacts, noises and
non-voice events;

I

Interoperability: BS3strategic maintains a full connectivity
and interoperability with the Master Repository BS3 system
where all voice models are stored and managed.

Capabilities:

+ Speaker ldentification (SID)
+ Gender ldentification (CID)
+ Language ldentification (LID)
Use Cases:

+ Speaker spotting of key targets inside a continuous

flow of telephone conversations (landline, cellular,
VOIP) in near-real time
Datamining for large storage repositories t o t a g or
classify individuals f o r further intelligence processing

Benefits:
Reduces dramatically the number o f calls in mass
voice interception system required f o r further
intelligence processing
Facilitates easy and quick speaker pursuit in huge
audio data storage

Key competitive advantages:
?

Based o n the market leading Bs3 Engine - Text, channel and language independence

3 High speed performance: 1,000 hours of audio processed in a day with a single CPU core (fastest scoring time available);
3 Small features and model sizes: respectively 7kB and 1.8kB (smallest ever used in the marketplace) - allowing up t o 1000 times
reduction in memory needed;

3 High accuracy: based on the state-of-the-art GMMIJFA voice biometric technology;

3 Multi-speaker

detection: u p t o 2-speakers in the same recording with the fastest and most efficient solution available in the

marketplace.
