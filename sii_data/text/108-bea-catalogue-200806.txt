MICRO2 STEREO
MICRO2 STEREO is an innovative audio surveillance
system designed for professional users.
MICRO2 STEREO has been realised to improve the
audio quality and to provide a more realistic acoustic
image of the environment under surveillance, thus
reducing listening fatigue and simplifying the
transcription activity.
The characteristics of the system including low
probability of interception, high audio quality and
extremely low transmitter power consumption make
the MICRO2 STEREO system ideal for both short and
long term concealed installations.

Main Features

- stereo transmitter with a dynamic range compressor
to work also with strong audio signals, that normally
saturate modulation stages of similar systems and
also to enhance very low perceptible signals, thanks
to an automatic gain control
- two hi-fi DSP (Digital Signal Processor) filters, that
allow maximum operative flexibility on both
channels, acting with:
- low pass, high pass and band pass filters
- counter phase noise cancelling
- 5-frequency bands equaliser, to enhance or attenuate
some audio frequencies or reduce eventual
reverberate, often present in the operating centres
-

• Innovative transmission system
The MICRO2 STEREO employs an innovative
patented pulsed transmission technique (Time
Modulation Very Wide Band) which makes it very
difficult to detect or intercept the transmission with
RF detectors and other conventional sweeping
techniques.

• Complete and modular system
The basic system is made by:
- MICRO2 STEREO - stereo microtransmitter
- MODULO STEREO - receiver card that gets the
signal from the microtransmitter and decodes it
- MASTER STEREO- listening base and docking
station of the MODULO. It enables real time
audio listening in the version:
- processed out - audio processed by DSP filters
(noise cancelling, notch, equalisation)
- monitor out - audio before and after DSP filtering
- direct out - audio not processed
It has also got a SNDIF output (Sony Philips Digital
InterFace) for connection to an external recorder.
The output audio is unprocessed (for judicial evidence).
• Command accessibility
Multifunctional OLED display (Organic Light Emitting
Diode) of latest generation, allowing:
- visualisation of the signal satus, field strenght,
volume control;
- selection from menu: mono/stereo, audio equaliser,
DSP processor, notch filter.

set independently.
The audio of a single target unit (ENEA or ENEA REC)
can be listened in real time and simultaneously
recorded on the PC hard disk.
A series of cyclical behaviours, like automatic track
download, can be scheduled and monitored.

ENEA MANAGER is composed by:
- ENEA MANAGER HARDWARE: a US Robotic Modem
and an interface are connected to a PC and to a
PSTN telephone line to transmit DTMF commands
to the units and to receive a feed-back from them.
It is possible not only to set the unit but also to get
information on the parameters set.

- ENEA MANAGER SOFTWARE: proprietary software
that manages the behaviour of the remote units
(setting parameters and alarms levels), and gets
information from them (status, monitored audio,
recorded tracks).
ENEA MANAGER simplyfies recording operations:
- it is possible to record in real time directly on PC,
or on PC and simultaneously on the remote unit, or
on the remote unit only.

GATE 2007
GATE 2007 is a Hardware/Software system designed to monitor
communication.
GATE 2007 is a system:
• expandable
it allows to add more servers to increase the performances
and the lines to be monitored in a transparent way
• multimedia
it is able to carry on different monitoring activities like
telephone and room eavesdropping (point to point both
inbound and outbound), internet, E-mail, fax, video calls and
GSM localisation.
• secure
the data are acquired and recorded on server, with access enabled according to the defined operational
hierarchies. The clients transmit the entry request to the service connection manager in an encrypted way. No
information on the access (like log-in or password) are memorized in permanent way on the clients. The data
are exported on Cd-rom/DVD with encoded algorithm to avoid any reading by unauthorized people, in case of
loss of their lost.

Applications and Features
GATE 2007 allows to receive, to record and to play the data acquired by monitoring a target via fixed and mobile
telephony, environmental audio monitoring devices, fax, SMS, E-mail and Web (in this case Internet pages are
reconstructed as they have been visualized by the target person).
The graphic interface of GATE 2007 is simple and intuitive. The functionalities and the tools are available on a
single screen, for an easy and immediate access to the information and their elaboration.
The recorded data are easily accessible on the table of the records, that sums up the most important information
related to each record and that allows to search it, also via the selected filters.
It is possible to slow down the playing of the audio files without modifying the tone and to insert some personalised
markers to highlight the most important parts of the track. The quality of the recordings can be improved by the
noise reduction function.
The "positioning" feature visualises the cell from which the communication originated and allows to draw the

Multimedia Recorders

Environmental and Telephone Audio Monitoring
It is possible to select a record from the record table and access to its track in order to play it and, in the same time, to write down its text
or to write a brief summary of it.
To facilitate the editing of the blotter it is possible to set the option of cyclical repetition of the track listened. This functionality can be directly
managed by keyboard, avoiding to interrupt the writing for activating the replay command with other tools, like for ex. the mouse.
In case of recordings with a fast speech or with strong pronunciation, the transcription can be facilitated slowing down the speed of
execution, without however altering the timbre and the tone of it. The speech identification is made easier by an anti-noise filter.
The SMSs and their content can likewise be visualized.

The system allows to insert on the eavesdropping graph some markers and notes in correspondence of particularly interesting events,
with the purpose to immediately found the track of interest and to cyclically replay it.

SIC3
The SIC3 is BEA's system for detection and jamming
of mobile phones operating. SIC3 is designed for use
in controlled buildings or restricted areas where the
safety and security of the personnel is paramount.

BEA is making this specialized advanced system
available because of today's heightened security and
safety concerns. We welcome the opportunity to
discuss your needs and customize the system design
to satisfy customer specific requirements.

Main Features
• Range
Detection and jamming of communication on 2G
(900 and 1800 MHz) and 3G (2100 MHz) frequency
range
• Controlled jamming
The inhibition activity can be manual or automatic
and it is limited exclusively to the area where the
targeted signal is detected and is present only
duration of the targeted communication
According to its composition, SIC3 system allows to:
- detect the telephone traffic - active mode
- detect and jam the telephone traffic - passive mode
• SMS detection
SMS messages, although short in duration, are also
detected and jammed by the remote units.

BR E A/08 06/08

• Modular and configurable
The SIC3 system basic configuration includes the
CENTRAL CONTROL UNIT connected to a PC
running the SIC3 software and an application
specific number of remote units which are
connected to the CCU.

GSM/UMTS Detectors and Jammers

Because cellular phones are often used for illegal
purposes (bugging, triggering bombs, etc.), the SIC3
system was developed to monitor cellular phone
activity and, where necessary, employ jamming
techniques to block cellular phone signals.
The SIC3 system is therefore ideal for installation in
prisons, military bases and other restricted access
areas, special controlled access buildings where cell
phone use is restricted

SIC3

Detection and Jamming of Mobile Phones

CENTRAL CONTROL UNIT
The CENTRAL CONTROL UNIT (CCU) is the core of the system.
The primary function of the CCU is to verify current status and operation of the remote units that
comprise the SIC3 system.
The CCU is connected to a dedicated PC running the SIC3 software. The CCU combined with the
dedicated software is capable of managing the operation of systems with over 200 remote units
installed. Despite this complexity the entire network can be managed by one operator.

SIC3 SOFTWARE
SIC3 SOFTWARE: runs on a PC that is connected to the CCU and is dedicated to the monitoring
and control of the SIC3 system.
The user friendly interface makes all aspects of system operation quick and easy. After all the
remote units have been configured, the system can be set to run unattended with automatic
detection and/or jamming of the radio signal traffic.
The software also compiles a database with statistical information on cell phone activity, jamming
and any operational notes for each sector. Analysis of this information can identify possible trouble
spots where further surveillance might be necessary.

REMOTE UNIT
REMOTE UNIT (RU) is installed in one sector of the total target area and is connected to the other
units and to the CCU via RS485 cable.
The RU coverage area is dependant on the environment in which it is installed. Therefore, the
number of remote units that are required will be determined after an accurate technical analysis of
the building(s) and/or area to be monitored is completed.
There can be several type of RU according the the function required, i.e. whether to work as both
a signal detector and jamming device and on which frequency it has to operate.
