vibration.

• 150W C ONTINUOUS D UTY IN HF,
62.5W C ONTINUOUS D UTY IN VHF

The WAVpac Linear Power Amplifier increases the range of a receivertransmitter by increasing the output to 150 watts in HF and 62.5 watts in VHF.
Switching of the amplifier’s internal harmonic filters is also automatically
accomplished with the built-in RS-485 control interface.
The WAVpac Linear Power Amplifier provides connections for an external
variable speed cooling fan kit. When this kit is installed, the amplifier is rated
for continuous duty key-down operation in all modes of service. The
amplifier’s high-performance harmonic filters are controlled
automatically from the receiver-transmitter.
The WAVpac Linear Power Amplifier is powered from a
18 to 32 VDC, negative-ground, vehicular source.
The small size, robust design and construction of these
power amplifiers guarantee continuous operation and high
reliability in the most demanding environments.
