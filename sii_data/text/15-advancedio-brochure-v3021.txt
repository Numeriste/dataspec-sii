V3021
Dual Channel 10 Gigabit Ethernet FPGA AMC

Benefits

Overview

Provides 10 Gigabit Ethernet line-rate processing via its high
performance architecture

Available in single-width AdvancedMC form factor, this high
performance packet processing module features dual 10
Gigabit Ethernet SFP+ optical ports and is available in a range
of Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA options providing scalable processing
performance. Its memory architecture is based on multiple
independent high-speed SDRAM and SRAM memory interfaces
that enable advanced 10 Gigabit Ethernet network traffic
processing. The V3021 supports PCI Express or XAUI fat
pipes for data exchange. It comes standard with expressXG
Development Framework, an advanced FPGA development
infrastructure that gives programmers the advantage to develop
their own high bandwidth applications rapidly and efficiently.

Improves overall system performance by providing additional
processing capabilities
Ideal for high bandwidth applications that require real time digital
signal processing
