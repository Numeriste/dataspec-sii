Advanced VIP Close Protection Course
Turkmenistan Presidential Guard
Issued: 18th December 2008

We have pleasure in providing a detailed syllabus and priced proposals for a 4 week
Advanced Close Protection VIP Course which would be conducted at our training
premises in the UK. There is also heavy emphasis on training current Instructors in latest methods and technologies and, combined, our expertise means that the majority of
the course is spent on practical exercises.
• 4 weeks equates to 20 working days of which we plan to spend at the Elaman Training facility at Tidworth, Hampshire.
• The 6 students will all be already trained to various standards of CP work.
• The course Aim will therefore be to train VIP CP Instructors with a correspondingly
heavy emphasis on VIP CP command, control and planning and on instructional
techniques.
• The course programme will provide in excess of a 70/30 split of practical/theoretical
work and will intersperse the above modules in a fully progressive manner.
• The number of instructors required full-time throughout the course and for a period
of planning, recce and liaison prior to the course will be four:
2 Chief Instructors double hatted as the command and control instructor
2 VIP CP Drills Instructor with lead responsibility for VIP CP drills, CAT drills and
weapon-training
2 Surveillance Instructor with lead responsibility for surveillance and countersurveillance, protective security, driver training and for assisting the VIP CP Drills
Instructor
2 Administrators
• A number of Cameo Staff will be required periodically throughout the course to
provide ‘players’ for the exercises including third party debriefs and to provide specialist instruction in communications, terrorist threat updates, aviation security, legal
framework briefings, first aid and unarmed combat.
The syllabus for this top of the range Course will comprise the following five headings
with detailed descriptions of what topics in each heading will be covered.
