VISIBLE VOICE
3D Real Time Spectrum Visualization Software

When the user starts to speak or sing into the
microphone, the moving waves of voice
spectrum appear in the PC screen. Visible
Voice calculates speech spectrum and
displays it in the screen in real time.

Applications
Multimedia or educational software
u

Testing and improvement of musical hearing
and singing skills

u

Teaching and acquisition of
foreign languages,
acoustics, linguistics,
spectral analysis, etc.

u

Tuning musical instruments

u

Viewing sound dynamic
characteristics in a music
shop, variety shows, night
clubs, etc.

Functional Overview

Advantages
u

The VOCAL RANGE (65 - 1000 Hz) in the
logarithmic frequency scale to watch the
pitch. While working in the vocal range you
can evaluate your ability to sing musical
notes and train your musical ear and voice.

u

The TOTAL RANGE (20 - 4500 Hz) in linear
frequency scale to watch the voice pitch and
the formants - the main resonances of speech
sounds, that is the most intensive spectrum
bands of speech pronunciation..

u

You will see a moving waterfall or mountain
landscape of your voice. In this display the
frequency (voice pitch) grows horizontally from
the left to the right, time grows vertically from
the top downward and the height of every
mountain shows the level of the analyzed voice
frequency.

u

Every new spectrum picture appears at the top
of the left-hand field and moves continually to
the bottom, keeping its original form. The
audible pitch of the input signal corresponds to
the left peak on the screen.

u

Other frequency peaks correspond to the
additional high tones of the voice and
characterize the sound quality of the voice and
its tone (timbre).

u

Therefore, looking at the moving graphical
image of your voice, you can easily evaluate
and train your ability to control the pitch,
sonority and fine tone of your voice.

When working in the total frequency range:

At first you will appreciate the melodic
characteristics of your voice. Voice usually has
many clearly visible tones of fundamental tone
and the considerably high “hill” in the range of
2200-3300 Hz (the range of the “singing”
formant).
Secondly you can evaluate the correctness of
your pronunciation of sounds, for example in a
foreign language. Every vowel has first three
formants (wide distinct spectral peaks) in the
specific frequency areas. Comparing your and
your teacher's formants (big “mountains” in the
spectral picture) of the same vowels, you can
control and train your skills in phonetics of
foreign language.
u

u

Using the piano keyboard you can test your
capabilities for music. A vertical line will appear
on the moving picture when you press by
mouse any piano key. Its position corresponds
to the note's frequency. Simultaneously the
computer speaker will generate the
appropriate tone and show the note name in
the note-box.

Technical Data
u

Application requires not less than Pentium
100 computer and 16 bit standard sound
card.

u

The program contains a detailed help.

u

You can make a snapshot of the left picture field
and put it into the right picture field.
