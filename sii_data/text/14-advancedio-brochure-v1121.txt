V1121
Dual Channel 10 Gigabit Ethernet XMC

Benefits

Overview

Provides high bandwidth 10 Gigabit Ethernet communications
for next generation radar and signal intelligence systems

The V1121 is the industry’s leading XMC solution that is designed
to provide a real time high-bandwidth network interface for next
generation radar and signal intellience systems. The V1121
features two 10 Gigabit Ethernet SFP+ optical interfaces and
supports the UDP, ARP and ICMP communication protocols. Its
advanced architecture and built-in Ethernet offload capabilities
provide data transfer at sustained rates exceeding 9.2Gbps.

Supports real time data streaming directly from sensors
Adapts with evolving application requirements providing a
technology contingency plan
A COTS solution reduces system size, power footprint and cost

Features
Two 10 Gigabit Ethernet SFP+ optical ports
Built-in UDP offload engine for real time communication
Supports PCI Express and XAUI host interfaces
Available with streaming front-end FPGA core for quick sensor
integration
Available with advanced APIs that support multi-core and multiprocessor architectures
Thermal sensors for monitoring card temperature
Available in air and conduction-cooled XMC form factor

advanced network intelligence

Unique in its ability to directly transfer data between 10 Gigabit
Ethernet networks and FPGA devices, the V1121 minimizes
the size and power footprint of systems by obviating the
need to introduce additional processors solely to run Ethernet
communications. A Streaming Front End (SFE), which is a small
core that resides on the FPGA device, provides an independent
interface to each 10 Gigabit Ethernet channel on the V1121.
The FPGA device communicates with the V1121 over XAUI
running across the Pn5 connector, as per VITA 42.6 standard.
In addition, the V1121 is uniquely suited to system architectures
involving multiple processing cards on a common switched
data plane. Specifically, the V1121 supports shared access
from multiple host processors, enabling it to function as a costeffective, high-performance 10 Gigabit Ethernet gateway. This
feature enables a single high-speed pipe to carry multiple virtual
channels in systems that need to spread or load balance sensor
data across processor farms. When used as a gateway, the V1121
supports PCI Express over the Pn5 connector for processor
communication and comes with high level APIs for control and
data transfer resulting in a simplified programming model.
