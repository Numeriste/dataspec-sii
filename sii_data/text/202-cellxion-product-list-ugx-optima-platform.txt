QMTS
Quad Modem Telemetry System

I.
I

*_

The quad modem telemetry system (QMTS) is a multi-role communications
platform designed to simultaneously utilise the wireless data networks of
up to 4 mobile network operators in a single geographic location. Data is
shared between carrier networks and aggregated in a central secure server
before being sent to any number of configured client machines. Sharing
the data payload across multiple networks leads to higher throughput and
greater resilience.
The device has an integrated router that manages the packet queue
internally, with all traffic carried over secure tunnels between the QMTS
and the secure server. In addition t o providing secure, reliable IP transport
at up to 4x a single modem solution, the QMTS has built-in GPS for
accurate position reporting and tracking.

KEY APPLICATIONS

BENEFITS AND KEY FEATURES

The QMTS has a wide variety of applications,
including:

The QMTS has a number of key benefits:

D Backhaul of video and other surveillance
traffic

D Use as a high bandwidth wireless router
Remote control of missions critical assets

D Higher bandwidth than using a single
operator
D Resilience from using multiple networks
D High security of data streams

D Vehicle tracking and monitoring

D System is designed to use low cost standard
data SlMs

D As a secure communications tool

D Built in router, switch & GPS
D Up to 64 GB of on board storage via micro
SD card
D Secure server can be located anywhere
including user's own secure data centres

D Secure server serves multiple QMTS devices
D On-board processor able to run bespoke
user applications.
