V5022
Quad Channel 10 Gigabit Ethernet FPGA PCI Express Card

Benefits

Overview

Enables a new generation of High Speed Trading systems

High Frequency Trading firms and exchanges require highperformance and ultra low latency programmable network cards
in order to accelerate trades in under 2 microseconds. The
V5022, a quad 10 Gigabit Ethernet Virtex-6 PCI Express card,
doubles port density and reduces latency by more than
50 percent when compared to other technologies on the market.
It provides the advanced features and performance needed to
gain a competitive edge in the marketplace.

Provides ultra-low latency interface to 10 Gigabit Ethernet
networks
Provides reliable performance in real time

Features
Quad 10 Gigabit Ethernet SFP+ optical ports
Xilinx Virtex-6 XC6VHX380T or XC6VHX565T FPGA
Two independent banks of up to 4GB DDR3 SDRAM
Four independent banks of up to 144Mbit QDRII+ SRAM
PCI Express x8 host interface (Gen 1 and Gen 2)
System monitor feature enabled
Dual boot image with fallback multi-boot feature
Mini SAS transceiver interface for intercard communication
RS-232 interface for application debugging
PPS interface for time synchronization with µSec resolution

Functional Description
The V5022 is built with purpose for processing high-bandwidth
network traffic in real time. As a build option, it supports the
HX380T and HX565T from Xilinx offering customers some key
benefits, including very high number of logic gates and reliable
communications. The two independent DDR3 SDRAM memory
interfaces provide adequate buffering to sustain traffic over 10
Gigabit Ethernet networks. In addition, the four independent
QDRII+ SRAM memory interfaces make the architecture ideal for
implementing advanced algorithms that require buffering or fast
look-up tables. Another key feature is the ability to connect cards
using a high-speed serial interface to allow direct communication
between cards in the system without host intervention. The
front panel has four 10 Gigabit Ethernet SFP+ optical ports that
support both short range and long range fiber.
The V5022 product is shipping with expressXG, AdvancedIO’s
flexible FPGA development framework, to allow fast application
development so customers can roll out new trading services on
the market quickly. AdvancedIO ensures extreme reliability that
gives customers confidence to deploy their product in critical
applications. Like other products in the same family, the V5022 is
compatible with several high-performance servers from leading
OEMs, such as HP ProLiant DL380 Generation 6. This single slot
solution allows customers to maximize the number of cards per
server, resulting in a smaller server footprint.
