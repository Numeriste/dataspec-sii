Artemis Advanced quickly gives
you confidence you are safe
Artemis Advanced is the very latest example in Audiotel
lnternational's long history of innovation in powerful,
multi-channel Non-Linear Junction Detector (NUD) technology.

Optimised for countering hybrid threats, by locating external ground
targets, surface or buried, it can also be used for internal searches of
meeting rooms, offices and public areas.
