V5031 Quad Channel FPGA PCI Express Card Architecture

 

Functional Description

 

The V5031 is a quad port 10 Gigabit Ethernet FPGA network
card with PCI Express Gen 3 host interface. The network
interface is provided through pluggable transceivers that
support short and long range ?ber.

By combining key technology from Altera, the V5031 network
card features the Stratix family of FPGAs, offering a range

of logic elements from 340,000 to 952,000. The Stratix 
scalability and high density makes it possible to support a wide
range of applications and to implement complex algorithms. Its
high capacity integrated transceivers are optimized for high-
performance, high-bandwidth applications. The pluggable
transceivers communicate directly with the Stratix device
using built-in physical layer interfaces (PHY), which dramatically
reduces the latency for data coming from and going to the
network interface.

The V5031 is available with a generous amount of memory to
handle the most demanding applications. The card features two
banks of up to BGB 72-bit wide memory running at a maximum
clock rate of They offer a potential 17 GBytes/s raw
bandwidth each. This could be used to provide buffering to sustain
burst traf?c over 10 Gigabit Ethernet networks with data accessible
from applications running on the FPGA or from the host.

In addition, there are four banks of up to 144Mb 18-bit wide
SRAM running at a maximum clock rate of They
offer a potential 2.2 GBytes/s raw bandwidth each. This makes
the architecture ideal for implementing advanced algorithms that
require buffering or fast look-up tables.

An 8-lane PCI Express Gen 3 host interface with built-in DMA
channels optimized for fast data transfers provides unmatched
bandwidth and speed while moving data between the card
and the host memory. PCI Express Gen 3 doubles the effective
bandwidth and adds protocol enhancements to increase
end-system performance. The V5031 card has the ability to
recon?gure the FPGA device without bringing down the host
interface, a key requirement for applications where frequent
downtime is not an option.

The V5031 card has a high-speed, low-latency transceiver
interface that allows direct communication between two cards in
the system without host intervention. This is particularly useful for
applications requiring extensive processing. it also allows for a soft
handover, an essential feature for high availability system design.

The V5031 card features an RS-232 interface and a software
utility for debugging FPGA applications. The card?s pulse per
second (PPS) interface can be used for time 
and stamping of data. It also supports the 1588 Precision
Time Protocol (PTP). The V5031 card comes with on-board
temperature sensors with shut-down and automatic restart
capability. The Stratix loads from an on-board FLASH with
support for two boot images.

Technical Speci?cations

 

The V5031 ships with the expressXG Development Framework,
a fully integrated package designed to deliver optimum
functionality and accelerate application development on the
V5031 network card. Advancele?s ?exible FPGA development
framework toolset provides the infrastructure necessary to
ensure rapid deployment of applications and allows seamless
portability to the latest generation of network interface cards.
The framework abstracts the details of Ethernet protocols and
interfaces, memory controllers and host fabric interfaces, thereby
reducing the development effort and schedule for designers to
implement custom algorithms.

AdvancedIO ensures extreme reliability that gives customers
confidence to deploy their products in critical applications. Like
other products in the same family, the V5031 card is compatible
with several high-perfonnance sewers from leading OEMs, such
as HP ProLiant DL380.11'1is single slot solution allows customers
to maximize the number of cards per server, resulting in a smaller
server footprint.
