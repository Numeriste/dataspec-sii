GigaBit Fiber Taps
Get total traffic visibility for monitoring and security devices by placing Net Optics GigaBit
Fiber Taps on critical network links. The new slim profile of the GigaBit Fiber Tap saves
rack space—install up to six Taps in a one rack unit panel. The all-optical design of the
GigaBit Fiber Tap is optimized and tested for high-performance on GigaBit fiber networks.
The all-optical design of the GigaBit Fiber Tap is optimized and tested for
high-performance on GigaBit fiber networks. Available for both singlemode and
multimode fiber, GigaBit Fiber Taps support passive monitoring of GigaBit links at speeds
at 1000 Mbps.
Requiring no power, the GigaBit Fiber Taps establish permanent passive access ports
without introducing a point of failure or disturbing other network connections. These
passive Taps deliver full-duplex monitoring with zero impact on network traffic around
the clock.

Operating Specifications:

Operating Temperature: -40ºC to 85ºC
Storage Temperature: -55ºC to 85ºC
Relative Humidity: 10%min, 95%max, non-condensing

Mechanical Specifications:

Dimensions: 0.809” high x 4.375” deep x 5.550” wide

Fiber Type:

Without an IP address, monitoring devices are isolated from the network, dramatically
reducing their exposure to attacks. However, the monitoring device connected to the Tap
still sees all full-duplex traffic as if it were in-line, including Layer 1 and Layer 2 errors.

Passive, Secure Technology

Connectors:

Full-duplex monitoring is a snap with a custom monitoring cable that sends each side of
the signal to a separate NIC on the monitoring device. All network and monitoring cables
necessary for plug-and-play deployment are included.

• Provides passive access at speeds at 1000 Mbps without data stream
interference or introducing a point of failure
• All-optical design is optimized and tested for GigaBit fiber networks
• Permanent in-line installation without affecting network performance
• Passes all full-duplex traffic (including errors) from all layers for comprehensive
troubleshooting
• No IP address is needed for the Tap or monitoring device, enhancing monitoring
security
• Completely transparent to the network and requires no power

Ease of Use

• Front-mounted network connectors for easy installation and operation
• Angled connectors minimize cable strain
