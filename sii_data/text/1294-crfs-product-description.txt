The RFeye Array uses a unique multi-layer approach that is
more sophisticated and versatile than traditional direction
finding. High performance spiral directional antenna modules
are optimized for different frequency bands and arranged in
multiple orientations.The Array is sensitive to the majority of
incoming signal polarizations including all linear polarizations,
allowing reliable detection of signals including those invisible to
most DF systems that use only vertically polarized antennas.

Guide to direction finding and geolocation
