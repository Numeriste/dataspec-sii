Remote Monitoring & Infection Solutions
FINSPY MOBILE

FinSpy Mobile is closing the gap of interception capabilities
for Governments for most common smart phone platforms.
Specifically, organizations without network or off-air
based interception capabilities can access Mobile Phones
and intercept the devices with enhanced capabilities.
Furthermore, the solution offers access to encrypted
communications as well as data stored on the devices
that is not transmitted.

QUICK INFORMATION
Usage:

· Strategic Operations
· Tactical Operations

Capabilities:

· Remote Mobile Phone
Monitoring

Content:

· Hardware/Software

Traditional tactical or strategic Interception solutions Face
challenges that can only be solved using offensive
systems like FinSpy Mobile:
· Data not transmitted over any network and kept on the
device
· Encrypted Communications in the Air-Interface, which
avoid the usage of tactical active or passive Off-Air Systems
· End-to-end encryption from the device such as Messengers,
Emails or PIN messages

Usage Example 1: Intelligence Agency

FinSpy Mobile has been giving successful results to
Government Agencies who gather information remotely
from Target Mobile Phones.

Usage Example 2: Organized Crime

When FinSpy Mobile is installed on a mobile phone it can be
remotely controlled and monitored no matter where in
the world the Target is located.

FinSpy Mobile was covertly deployed on the mobile
phones of several members of an Organized Crime Group
(OCG). Using the GPS tracking data and silent calls,
essential information could be gathered from every
meeting that was held by this group.

FinSpy Mobile was deployed on BlackBerry mobile
phones of several Targets to monitor all communications,
including SMS/MMS, Email and BlackBerry Messenger.
