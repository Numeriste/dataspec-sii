Architecture Description 1/3
- IP Front-end (APIX)
• Collect all CC delivered in IP format (VoIP, e-mail, internet traffic, etc.)
• Connected to the central storage and the Demodulation & decoding units
- Demodulation and decoding unit
• Demodulation and decoding of received IP Data
• CC Analysis of the incoming IP traffic,
• Categorization and Classification of the traffic
• Connected to the Storage unit to save the de
Rendering and presentation unit
• Processing of the decoded data to create :
• previews,
• listings and
• additional presentation layers

Architecture Description 213
- Indexing and live navigation unit
• Access to the stored decoded results and the previews and presentation
layers
• Indexation of all stored and processed data to create a live navigation
view
=>immediate display of decoded results
=>easy navigation and analysis within a huge amount of data instantly

- Storage unit
• Storage of Raw Data and Decoded Data
• Storage capacity of more than 40 Terabyte,
• In operation expandable memory and bandwidth architecture
• High availability and state of the art redundancy
• Field proven hardware and software products from world class
manufacturers
17

Architecture Description 3/3
- Redundancy
• Architecture based on high availability servers, capable to serve all
functionalities
• In case of system failure, minimizing of Data loss, recovery time and
cost.
