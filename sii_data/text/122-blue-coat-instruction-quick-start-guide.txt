Blue Coat SG200 Quick Start Guide

The Web Setup Wizard method allows you to use a directly-connected PC and a network connection to:
•

Assign the appliance IP, DNS, and gateway addresses.

•

Set access credentials and CLI password.

•

Configure Application Delivery Network (ADN) options, select what traffic type(s) to intercept, and
set the default allow/deny policy.

This can be performed anywhere. The Blue Coat SG200 can then be rack-mounted and/or connected
to its permanent network position.
The serial console allows you to use a terminal or PC running terminal emulation software to:
•

Assign the appliance IP, DNS, and gateway addresses.

•

Set access credentials and CLI password.

The Blue Coat SG200 can then be accessed from a browser for further feature configuration.
