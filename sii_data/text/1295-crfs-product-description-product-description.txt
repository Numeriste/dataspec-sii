RFeyeP Detect, Analyze, Geolocate

The RFeye - a unique approach
CRFS pioneered the concept of remote, distributed, real-time networks of intelligent
spectrum sensors providing continuous 2417 monitoring of the RF environment.
The RFeye was designed as a completely new

based deployment of cost-effective networks of
nodes continuously monitoring areas of interest and

log all spectrum data or to record only data of
interest in certain bands or above certain thresholds.

accessible from anywhere in the world via IPThe
RFeye Node was created specifically t o meet these

Background masks, thresholds and alarms can all be
programmed remotely.
The RFeye has "multi-user, multi-mission" capability

- i.e. it can be used to perform near-simultaneous

Lightweight, low power, small footprint and housed
in a robust IP67 enclosure, RFeye Nodes are simple t o
install, connect and start u p and, once fitted, they take

tasks (detection, analysis, geolocation) and can be
simultaneously accessed by multiple users, each of

care of themselves. "Fit and forget'.' Each Node has its
own in-built Linux processor and proprietary control
protocol that allows it t o operate fully autonomously
and, where required, in cooperation with other Nodes
in the network. No local PC server is required and each
network node is directly IP addressable.
Through careful design w e created a compact
packaged unit at an attractive price-point without
sacrificing RF performance. We paid special attention
to achieving an excellent noise figure and very low
spurious elements despite the size constraints.
The RFeye provides 2417 real-time access and also
records data for subsequent analysis and playback.
Data can be logged t o local USB or solid state memory
or relayed over IP t o a central server. On-board

w h o m can request different information.This enables
the most efficient and cost-effective use of the assets.

RFeye systems are used on sensitive sites and
installations, along borders and in buildings, for
detection of suspicious or unauthorized transmissions
that may indicate a potential threat, security
breach or cyber attack.They are also deployed on
spectrum critical sites, such as government ranges,
military bases and training grounds, to manage
essential frequency bands and locate any sources
of interference.~

RFeye Secure provides a high level of security for the

rooms, Sensitive Compartmented Information
Facilities (SCIF), Secure Work Environments (SWE)
and facilities containing Special Access Programmes
(SAP). By detecting the presence, location and
signal characteristics of suspicious transmitters
such as bugging devices, or detecting unusual

response requirements for any spectrum intensive or
sensitive locations such as critical infrastructure sites,
military training & proving grounds, airport facilities,
sports stadia and special event arenas. Sources of
unauthorized transmissions can be quickly identified,
investigated and geolocated using reliable techniques
such asTime Difference of Arrival (TDOA), Power on
Arrival (POA) and Angle of Arrival (AOA).This can
lead to fast resolution of spectrum conflicts and help
support spectrum operations on the site. RFeye Detect
can also be deployed for intercepting unexpected
or unauthorized wireless activity along borders,
coastlines or harbours, as an indicator of potential
illegal activity such as illegal entry or trafficking of
people or goods.

Processed RFeye network data accessed via RFeye
Monitor web browser interface
RFeye Monitor is an integrated, fully configurable
system for collecting and managing spectrum data
using a network of widely distributed nodes. It is
aimed at national regulators and other spectrum
stakeholders who require accurate and current data to
support planning and operational decision-making. It
provides up-to-the-minute information about spectrum
sage, occupancy, events and violations, across all
m, as well as fully programmable

ns. A highly efficient database and
web portal interface provides streamlined data access.
The whole system is designed for data security and
integrity, optimal system speed and convenience of
user interface.

RFeye Map is a mobile spectrum monitorin
for collection, management and analysis of very large
spectrum data sets. It produces detailed maps of
spectrum usage from national level down to individual
street locations enabling national regulators or
spectrum site operations to understand and anticipate
"pinch" points and
vulnerabilities,
monitor compliance,
identify and monitor
trends over the long
term. It provides
a unique view of
spectrum usage
that can greatly
inform policy and
improve planning and
decision-making.
