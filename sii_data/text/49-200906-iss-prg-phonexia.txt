Needle in a haystack
! Speech is the most important modality of human-human
communication 45608 of information: ; criminals and
terrorists are also communicating by speech
! Speech is easy to acquire in both civilian and
intelligence/defense scenarios.
! More difficult is to find what we are looking for
! Typically done by human experts, but always count on:
"
"
"
"

Limited personnel
Limited budget
Not enough languages spoken
Insufficient security clearances

Technologies of speech processing are not almighty but can
help to narrow the search space.

What was said ?
! Speech recognition
" Complete transcription - Large Vocabulary Continuous speech
recognition (LVCSR): transcription, speech to text, S2T.
" Detection of keywords / keyphrases " keyword spotting (KWS),
spoken term detection (STD)

Which language ?
! Language recognition (LRE), Language identification (LID)

Who said it ?
! choose one out of a set of N speakers " speaker identification
! confirm the claimed identity of a speaker " speaker verification
! Haven*t heard the speaker before " age ID, gender ID, etc.

Speech@FIT at BUT
! University research
group established in
1997
! 20 people in 2009
(faculty, researchers,
students, support staff).
! Provides also
education within Dpt. of
Computer Graphics
and Multimedia.
! Cooperating with EU
and US universities
and companies.
! Supported by EC, US
and national projects
The goal: high profile research in speech theory, algorithms and
software implementation

Focus on evaluations

!
!

!
!

AICm better than the other guysF " not relevant unless the same data and
evaluation metrics for everyone.
NIST " US Government Agency, http://www.nist.gov/speech
Regular benchmark campaigns " evaluations " of speech technologies.
All participants have the same data and have the same limited time to
process them and send results to NIST => objective comparison.
The results and details of systems are discussed at NIST workshops.
Speech@FIT extensively participating in NIST evaluations:
!
!
!
!

Transcription 2005, 2006, 2007, 2009
Language ID 2003, 2005, 2007, 2009 (now!)
Speaker Verification 1998, 1999, 2006, 2008,
Spoken term detection 2006

Why are we doing this ?
! We believe that evaluations are really advancing the state of the art
! Do not want to waste our time on useless work ;

speaker before ?
Gender ID
! The easiest speech application to
deploy ;
! ; and the most accurate 4\9^8 on 
challenging channels)
! Limits search space by 50%

19/28

Keyword spotting
Technical approach
! Comparing keyword model output with an anti-model.
! Key question: what is the needed tradeoff between
speed and accuracy?

Acoustic
! Fast
! No problem with OOV
L Can not index " new keyword
mens new processing of all the
data
L Does not have language model
" problem with short keywords.

LVCSR
! once indexed, the search is very
fast
! More precise.
L More complex, recognition is
slower
L Limited vocabulary " OOV
