NiceTrack Horizon Insiaht
The NiceTrackTMHorizon
Insight is the NICE Intelligenceplatform for mass interception and analysis of very high
volumes and rates of communications data (e.g., telephony, IP and open source) for intelligence organizations,
SlGlNT agencies and Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAS).The platform is designed to automatically extract and
produce valuable intelligencefrom vast amounts of intercepted communication data and to detect and identify
new targets and suspects from billions of voice, text, metadata and location events per day. It supports all types
of intelligenceproduction scenarios, including complex alerting for preventive intelligence, real-time operations,
and various workflows for communications-driveninvestigations and monitoring.

Communications Metadata - Mass Interception
and Analysis
The NiceTrack Horizon Insight platform provides nationwide
interception and analysis of communications metadata, including
CDR (Call Detail Records), IPDR (Internet Protocol Detail Records)
and other network events. These records enable analysts to gain
insights on target and suspect activities.
The benefits for communications metadata intercept~onand analysis
include:

â‚¬xpuse Entire Target Networks
Visualizes all communications-based relationships between targets
and unknown suspects to expand the accessibility and information
associated with criminals and terrorists

Find Hidden Indirect Chmctbns
Reveals mediators and mediator groups involved in connecting several
targets and assisting in concealing criminal activity

The benefits for communications location data interception and
analysis include:

Locate Anyone, AnyZime, Anywhere
Get accurate and reliable positioning data on any subscriber in urban
and rural environments both indoor and outdoor.

M a s s Location Profiling
Creates routine behavior profiles based on location data for entire
populations or specific geographical areas, by identifying locationbased patterns and alerting suspicious activities
