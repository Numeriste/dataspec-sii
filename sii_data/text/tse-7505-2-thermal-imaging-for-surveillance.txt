Surveillance Aplication

Detects people in total darkness and allows covert distance surveillance
• Covert Surveillance
• Monitoring of arrivals and departures
• Monitoring of open areas
• Safer parks initiatives
In darkness, thermal imaging gives the ability to “see” in zero light conditions proving valuable in many situations.
Surveillance features
• High resolution 160x120 pixel image
• Large clear screen
• Auto hotspot tracker – useful for highlighting people
• Selectable colour palettes
• Digital x2 zoom
• Optional Screen Shade to prevent light emission/reflection Image storage to SD card
An important tool for “sweeping” buildings
For non-alerting bug detection, the unit provides measurement of surface temperatures
and visible indication of irregularities. Where a listening device/bug is working, it may alter
the temperature of the adjacent material/wall.
Î This temperature difference will be shown as a “hot spot”
During house searches, the unit has been used at arms length, to scan into cupboards, difficult to reach places, loft hatches etc.
Î A picture is taken and the unit withdrawn so the images can be looked at before the
officer enters the confined space
Firearms teams have been using this unit during recent exercises and operations to great
success.
Scope of Delivery
The unit comes with:
• Camera and rechargeable battery
• Wrsit strap
• Carry case
