Introduction
The solution descibed is referred to as the Location Reporting & Tracking Platform, or
LRTP. The facility to provide Location Interrogation of GSM mobile phones has already
been successfully proven and utilized for some time. For the solution to be truly effective,
sustaining and to provide a quality of service at critical times will require CLIENT to
provide, or otherwise formally arrange, access to certain data and the ability to implement
suitable hardware, software and services with 1 (one) local GSM operator. This proposal
describes the primary components and services that are required to enable the solution.
It is also important to note that the platform alone is not the sole element to deliver the
quality results that are expected. It should be clear from earlier presentations and
supporting introductory documents that this solution is not a “black-box” solution where
the equipment alone needs to be procured or utilised. The platform will require the formal
and legal access to enable the interrogation of each of the local GSM Service Providers. It
is assumed that CLIENT has the authority and mandate to request such permanent
access from both the primary Host Operator, in which the special equipment is installed
or connected to, plus the other GSM Operators’ relevant corporate entities. In addition to
the formal access, the complete and correct raw cell data is required to be available to
which it shall be supplemented by additional information, standardized into a common
format, and maintained by suitably qualified and experienced telecommunication
engineers. Periodically, as the GSM networks continue to expand, it is imperative that the
LRTP database is continuously updated and managed.
The document describes therefore not just the hardware & software and implementation
service, but also the recommended on-going services that will be required to ensure the
system delivers both the return on investment and the quality of service expected.

3.1

Location / Cell Data

The location data required by the LRTP includes LAC and Cell ID, sector and longitude
and latitude data. This data is partially available from the GSM Service providers, such
as the LAC and Cell ID, but will require supplementary addition of the global coordinates and readable names of locations.
This comprehensive data is used by the platform to overlay location identification and
animated tracking of time-based reports. The quality of the data is imperative to the
successful operation of the platform and requires periodic maintenance as new
BTS/Cell network infrastructure is progressively added and upgraded by GSM
providers. This means that CLIENT has to make arrangements with the GSM Network
providers in order to get updates as soon as the network planning concerning Cells
has changed.
In order to provide the full service functionality to delivery the desired output,
1rstWAP requires the following minimum set of data for each GSM Cell. 1rstWAP
action is to process, improve and implement these data sets in the LRTP:

Single MSISDN Location Check (FastTrax)

FastTrax is the name used by 1rstWAP to describe the single entry location query of a
particular mobile phone or GSM SIM card enabled device. The FastTrax module is a
simple to use, single entry facility that allows the operator to enter a single MSISDN
and enact a single location check.These requests can be initiated directly from the
FastTrax web-based application, from a registered (qualified) mobile phone (see
FastTrax-MO below) or from the LRTP server console.

(Entry Section)

•
•

•

The “target” mobile MSISDN (hand phone number) is entered in the relevant field.
Options exist for the selection of the query type; ATI (Any Time Interrogation) or
PSI (Provide Subscriber Information). ATI is the default setting. PSI involves
“forcing” a paging (via type zero SMS) to the hand phone which will result in an
update of the HLR.
The result of the query will provide the detailed screen such as that shown on the
next page
(Remainder of page intentionally left blank)

(Target Interrogation Result Page)

•

The “target” MSISDN is described in 3 data sets;
¾ ENTRY – This shows the entry data used to make the query and the result
category. (Target Interrogation Successful is the best result). Alternate
information is returned that can include suggestions to the user to try a PSI
query, if ATI does not delivery the complete results. The information will assist
the user understand the result quality of the query.
¾ Location Address Data – “Target located in the vicinity of….”. This includes the
name defined in the database of the geographical location to which
BTS/Cell(center) the target is currently (or previously attached). The result
denotes the TIME of the result and the PHONE STATUS, both of which
provide positive indications to the current or historic status. Phone status can
be IDLE (turned on and not used), IN USE (turned on and being used) or
ABSENT (The phone is not logged onto any network, as per the data in the
HLR).
¾ Map Links – Currently two map links are provided to enable a user with
internet access to link the query. These are provided with the standard
implementation but with very simple customisation, links to the CLIENT’s own
mapping application can be achieved. Such map application could be Mapinfo.
The current Google links provide a positive proof of concept. See example on
the next page:

Longitude and Latitude are provided in the result and is the source for mapping
interface. The values are digital co-ordinates.
Telco Data includes the Home Network of the target, the Roaming (or currently
active) Network, the MSC global title obtained from the query and the MSC
global title name obtained from the LRTP database, the Cell Reference which
provides a unique identifier which is mapped to the Cell Data in the LRTP
database and provides the co-ordinate and address values, Azimuth and Radius
Sector radius will be used when operator provides this cell information to
CLIENT.

FastTrax Scheduler

Selecting the Tab “Schedule” for the Scheduling functions, operators have the option to
set the start and end date, the interval of location checkings, the days or the hours.

4.2.2

FastTrax History Function

The FastTrax “History” Tab provides an easy way to find previous location queries. The
ten last interrogated mobile numbers are listed already in the “Locate” Tab. However, the
detailed search possibility of the History function allows to find particular previous
interrogations based on criteria such as date, MISIDN or alias name.

FastTrax-MO Feature

FastTrax-MO is the name used by 1rstWAP to describe the ability of a registered (whitelisted, duly authorized) user to request the single entry location query of a particular
MSISDN from his/her mobile GSM device. The system receives and logs the requests
initiated directly from the FastTrax application (via Internet/Intranet) and the FastTrax-MO
(via SMS) from a registered (qualified) mobile in the same way. The reports of all queries
are available in the FastTrax MO Admin application. The creation and configuration of a
new user for either FastTrax or FastTrax-MO is through the FastTrax MO Admin
application.

FastTrax MO Admin Application

The FastTrax MO Admin application provides a web-based interface to administrate
platform users and user authorizations, incl. white listing of mobile GSM devices for
MO location queries, i.e. location tracking of targets via the mobile device of CLIENT’s
operators/field personnel. Furthermore, it allows to blacklist certain MSIDNS so that
these blacklisted MSIDNS cannot be tracked/located by the users of the systems (e.g.
to protect the privacy of certain individuals). Another important monitoring and
supervision feature is the Location Request History, with which an Administrator can
monitor the location checking activities of his operators.

4.3

Multiple Targets and Periodic Location Checks (FTrax)
Unlike FastTrax (single number, current location), the FTrax application allows for
a complete management of multiple targets (GSM and GPS based) and ability to
perform and report user-defined, automated periodic location checks. This allows
the operator to define a target and define the time interval that the system will
automatically perform a location check. Each check will be logged in a report
available to be viewed on screen or downloaded for later data mining, archiving,
integration with other data, resorting, etc. Further advanced system features such
as vicinity alert (2 targets are in close proximity to each other) are currently in
development.
The Reports generated and all user Location Requests are also logged in the
system audit logs which provide a means of applying controls on system usage
and system generated reports.
The basic process is as follows:

CONFIDENTIAL – Subject to change without prior notice!

17

•
•
•
•

•
•
•

The “target” must be registered in the system as a “traceable entity” object.
The object is marked as “Locate” and the current location data is retrieved from
the GSM network either; (1) One-off, meaning current location or (2) marked for
tracking for set length of time where periodic queries run for a defined period.
The system receives and processes the data. This variable information is merged
with fixed infrastructure locations.
The web application displays the “target”, respectively its GSM Cell (or GPS)
location on suitable digital maps. (see Fig 1) Besides the “graphical” display, the
option to view textual detail also exists. The operator can drill-down to lower level
maps as far as available and whenever appropriate. (see Fig 2)
The authorized officer will manage the target and the information distribution.
The maps and supporting detailed information, including history through animation,
can be viewed via encrypted IP connection.
Updates can be further distributed to (authorized) staff via SMS, which can display
the textual data. This can be updated at periodic intervals as defined.

Fig. 1

Fig. 2

Naturally the process described can be expanded to various permutations based on
requirements. The basic concept is that a TARGET, respectively its GSM Cell location
is defined and overlayed as spatial data on a digital map plus available in text detail.
The database can maintain historic records of periodic updates and replay these as
required and also to provide detailed audit logs. Update locations can be automatically
dispatched externally from the platform, as required, to limited (authorized)
distribution list by various media, primarily as SMS. Equally, an incoming SMS query
from a “white-listed” hand-phone can also trigger a target interrogation, plus
response, supported by activity audit trail.

4.4

Mapping

The platform has a method to implement various map formats, with digital maps
being the most ideal although not mandatory. The database contains various maps (as
needed by the user) to overlay the target location. Maps can be “photo” type such as
Google Earth, other satellite or aerial images; they may be “street-directory” style
displaying street names and other landmarks. The platform is capable to utilise any
map, which acts as the under-lay to provide graphical identification suitable to the
user. CLIENT must provide maps with at least 2 GPS reference points for further
processing and implementation in the platform.

CONFIDENTIAL – Subject to change without prior notice!

18

Depending on the zoom level maps with different scales are displayed. During system
planning it has to be agreed which and how many different scales and maps shall be
used (See also Pricing Notes in the Commercial section). Maps have to be provided
by CLIENT prior to LRTP installation. Optional a map administration tool with map
administration training can be provided.
For each level of map:
•

All Maps in level must have longitude and latitude coordinates annotated
clearly around the edges of the maps (minimum longitude and latitude for top
left and bottom right positions. These coordinates will be used in the
calibration of the system)

•

Either 1 file containing a map with the whole of that level OR

•

Multiple files containing map parts for a level

•

Map format should be in jpeg format (or similar format that can be converted
into jpeg format using Photoshop©, freehand or similar product)

•

If map is not in jpeg format, or a format which can be imported into
Photoshop, the name of the system used to create the map should be
provided, and if possible an installable copy of the software (plus license
details) should be included with the map delivery

Maps can be delivered to 1rstWAP electronically - email, FTP, CDRom, Flash Drive or by courier.
The supply of maps is the responsibility of CLIENT. 1rstWAP shall undertake the
calibration and installment into the LRTP based on the offering.

LRTP Suite Special Features
4.5.1

SMS Broadcast (MobileBroadcast)

The platform has the capability to be enabled (as an option) as a carrier-grade
SMSC. This will naturally be dependant on CLIENT’s agreement with Host
Operator allowing such capability, but the platform can enable the CLIENT to send
high volume and priority SMS to its permitted community. This powerful tool will

CONFIDENTIAL – Subject to change without prior notice!

19

enable CLIENT’s organisation to send SMS to a large number of people extremely
quickly. (System configured with 4 x E1 Timeslots, with each link capable of up to
10 sms/sec, resulting in up to 2,400 SMS per min or up to 144,000 SMS sending
per hour). We call this facility MobileBroadcast.
What is MobileBroadcast:
This facility provides a 2-way inter-active SMS messaging facility that utilizes SMS as the
means of communication. It is, in short, a carrier-grade SMS - Send and Receive facility.
The primary benefits to CLIENT of this module is that it requires very little training, is very
simple and intuitive to use. This powerful communication tool with high throughput
performance empowers CLIENT to reach 10’s of thousands of people in a matter of
minutes.
Primary Features;

Send a single message (SMS) to a single number or broadcast a message to
thousands of people
You have options of manually entering the destination number(s), selecting from your
stored numbers in the application’s Phone Book or importing a list of numbers from
an offline database. (csv file import)
You have options of sender identification; either a name, e.g. “ CLIENT-ABC ”, or a
long “virtual” number to which people can reply or send to.
All replies or messages sent to your “Virtual Number Range” can be viewed from the
web application, they can be received in massively high volume with no congestion,
no “memory full”, always available. (see “What are Virtual Numbers” below)
Virtual Number replies can be subsequently downloaded for further sorting or
reprocessing.
Provides detailed Delivery reports for all messages sent so you can identify clearly if
your message was received or not (and specifically, why not!)
You can send messages “immediately” or schedule them for a specific time in the
future.
Your messages can be “personalized” with recipients name in the same batched
broadcast.

What are Virtual Numbers and how do they benefit CLIENT?
The LRTP iSMSC will be configured with a Global Title (GT) and National
Pointcode (NPC). Additionally, it is suggested that CLIENT requests the Host
Operator to allocate a number block (assigned to virtual HLR in the 1rstWAP
Messaging Node). This will take the form of a number range to which the LRTP
can utilize as Virtual Numbers. The system can SEND messages from these
numbers and replies or SMS-MO can be RECEIVED and processed by the
system. The iSMSC is therefore a “supper sender and receiver” of SMS. Virtual
Numbers can be used by the CLIENT for several purposes but primarily as
MSISDN that are terminated in the system rather than into a SIM card. SMS
received to Virtual Numbers can be configured such that they can be;
•
•

•

Redirected into the MobileBroadcast application and become “machine
terminated” and read through the application and later stored;
Automatically replied to with some custom applications (not included in
standard LRTP offering) such that senders can be provided with SMS
feedback. Presume this to be similar to “fax-back” services except where
SMS is the communication medium.
Allocated to various application that can be created for CLIENT (not included
in standard LRTP offering) such as “hiding“ the sender but allowing bidirectional messaging.

CONFIDENTIAL – Subject to change without prior notice!

20

•

Provides anonymous sender capability most suitable CLIENT staff, who do
not want to give up a personal number but hide their identity. Staff of the
CLIENT could be allocated a “Virtual Number”, which is mapped to his active
number. This virtual number can remain static whilst the active number could
be interchangeable. All SMS received could be redirect to the staff. The
facility could allow CLIENT staff to also send SMS from his active phone and
it will appear to come from his virtual number on the receivers phone.

4.5.2

SMS Spoofing – Pretend to be Someone Else

The platform has the capability to “spoof” a sender ID on SMS. This means that
CLIENT will have the ability to “pretend” to be another party. Such SMS sender
spoofing techniques have been already successfully used to trap, mislead, or to
confuse targets. As a tool in anti terrorism, the LRTP can enable CLIENT to send
SMS to target to whom it seeks to manipulate their communication by assuming
the identity of another to whom they may trust. An example of this might be to
send a message to one or more targets using the actual phone number of another
in their group. This information may be to fool the recipient to go somewhere or
do some action to which allows CLIENT to capture, identify, extract information
from targets or similar. In summary, it provides the capability of impersonating
another person through SMS.

4.6

Connectivity with Local GSM Service Providers
The platform requires a SS7 connection with at least one GSM Service Provider that
has inter-working relationship with other relevant GSM Service Providers in the area
to be covered. The platform requires the interrogation of the target entity’s HLR, VRL
& MSC. The platform requires constant availability to make such interrogation.
The platform interrogates the GSM Network provider(s) network infrastructure based
on standard GSM (ESTI) implementations of HLR, VLR and MSC. If a GSM Network
provider has non-standard GSM (ETSI) implementations of the above mentioned
network components installed in his network, CLIENT has to provide the respective
information to 1rstWAP prior to system installation and 1rstWAP will investigate
whether and how such a non-standard implementation can be accommodated.
Dependent on the required effort, such a specific development can be subject to
additional costs (See also Pricing Notes in the Commercial section).
It is assumed that CLIENT has the authority and mandate to request such permanent
access from the primary Host Operator, to which the special equipment is
connected, and the rights to interrogate the other GSM Operators’ mobile devices.
The LRTP will be located in a secure environment within the CLIENT’s Site Location.
CLIENT need to ensure that 1rstWAP can install and as far as required and agreed
remotely maintain the LRTP. All the GSM Service Providers also need to include the
global title (GT) of the platform’s iSMSC into their SMSC white-list to permit legal and
controlled HLR interrogations. (ITU standards – IR.21 document)
See also Pricing Notes in the Commercial section: CLIENT remains responsible for
any charges imposed from any of the GSM Operators in connection with SS7 and IP
connectivity, cell data provisioning and SMS traffic consumed by CLIENT. The
assumption is that CLIENT has an existing agreement with operator(s) for the
purpose of GSM interrogation. The iSMSC is therefore provisioned under contract
between the Host Operator and CLIENT and hence, 1rstWAP is the nominated
“Operational Service Facility” on behalf of CLIENT.

Schematic showing relationship between SS7 system components

4.7

Access to Location Data outside Client’s Country
The LRTP will enable CLIENT to interrogate the SS7 network location information of
any MSISDN of the Host Operator or ANY operator with whom the Host Operator
has an SMS interworking agreement with (basically, any network where a subscriber
of the Host Operator can send an SMS) and that has not blocked the Host Operator
in regard to PSI and/or ATI interrogations. As such, a location query could be effected
on a MSISDN of a target outside the home country of CLIENT and Host Operator. It
can be assumed that a result could provide a specific MSC but not the “physical
location”. It could be that this information is required by CLIENT and is not available
through information supplied from the Host Operator, and CLIENT does not wish to
make it known to the Host Operator of such query. 1rstWAP risk mitigation can be an
optionally procured service used to define the problem through relationship
networking. Specifically, 1rstWAP can apply discretion and stealth to try to obtain
information directly from specific GSM operators that is normally NOT provided to
3rd parties, even though it is not actually commercially or technically sensitive. Also,
1rstWAP have the potential to obtain the information via a query using our own
commercial nodes and other commercial Location Based Solution (LBS) business.
Thus, we can seek the answer from various sources which may not be available to
CLIENT who have the limitation of a single (LRTP) node. Currently, 1rstWAP
maintains a MSC database of ca. 16.000 MSCs in ca. 158 countries of which ca.
4.000 MSC locations are known to 1rstWAP through its commercial activities. The
MSC database entries are continuously improved and enlarged. Assumptions are
made on the coverage area of a MSC based on usual MSC coverage ranges.
1rstWAP does not guarantee location information of remote area MSCs and MSCs
still unknown to 1rstWAP. Furthermore, 1rstWAP’s commercial activities enable it to
maintain and enlarge its own Cell Data database in several countries. A list of
countries with MSC data availability can be provided on request.

22

Such “service” can also be applied to other Telco Related Anomalies (primarily
outside the sovereign country):
Situations may exist where it becomes necessary for CLIENT to understand whether
an operator outside the sovereign country has already implemented ATI, and where
they have, whether they have implemented “white-listing” (allowing specific SMSCs)
or “black-listing (preventing specific SMSCs) which prevent the expected result from
being made available. 1rstWAP risk mitigation can be the service to used to define
the problem through relationship networking. Specifically, and as mentioned above,
1rstWAP can obtain information from many GSM operators through personal /
professional relationship links, discretion and stealth.
In countries where number portability exists, and the desired result is not provided,
CLIENT will may need to least contact CLIENT’s peer organization to determine
definitive location. The primary variable will be “which operator” to contact. (1rstWAP
risk mitigation can be the service used to define the problem through relationship
networking. It may be possible though 1rstWAP’s own nodes to determine an
answer and if required, to make requests through social channels to define the carrier
to which the MSISDN currently belongs and subsequently define the location).
Specifically, and as mentioned above, 1rstWAP can obtain information from many
GSM operators through personal / professional relationship links, discretion and
stealth.
The incidence where CLIENT is able, due to favourable circumstances, to make direct
contact with an operator, the problem will be to determine the most direct path to
the relevant engineering manager to contact at the relevant operator.
1rstWAP can provide a risk mitigation service which can be the service used to assist
CLIENT to define mobile operator problems through relationship networking.
Additionally, information such as location data that 1rstWAP owns in its own
database (NOT related to any other LRTP client) can be made available to CLIENT to
supplement their database. As each client will have varying needs and capabilities,
this sensitive issue can never be distinctly defined in this proposal and can be
included after detailed discussions with CLIENT at the appropriate time.
