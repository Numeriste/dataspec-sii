GSM Mobile Finder (GSM-MF)
User’s Manual

1. General Description
In connection with the GSM mobile tracer & locator (GSM-MTL3), the GSM mobile
finder (GSM-MF) enables pinpoint localization of mobile phones. The device
provides 50 reception channels for selection of an unassigned frequency.
The wide range of its reception dynamics (-100 dBm to +7 dBm) ensures
localization of both adjacent and distant mobile phones.
An especially designed aerial enables systematic direction detection and, thus, a
rapid approach to the sought mobile phone.
The compact design of the device ensures concealed operation.
Absolute reception field strength of the respective channel is shown on a display
(1 dB steps).
Relative field strength is signaled through changing tone pitch or intermitted
sound.

2. Getting started
1. Secure power supply. Power supply occurs via a 9 V battery which has to be
inserted into the battery case on the bottom side of the device.
2. Connect a suitable direction finding aerial (900 MHz range) - (aerial connection
[7])
3. Connect headphones.
Use the ON/OFF switch [9] to switch on the GSM-MF. After a short initialization
phase, the device will be ready for operation on the basis of the latest settings
saved

3. Settings
Default settings of the GSM-MF are realized via the menu system.
Use the following keys:
[M]
[¿]
[À]
[S]

Retrieve menu and submenus
Select menu functions or menu
values
Save and close menu

4. Direction finding
Select a free traffic channel and put the mobile device into transmission mode (e.g.
silent call). This can be realized by means of the GSM Mobile Tracer & Locator
GSM-MTL 3 or any other suitable device.
Adjust the selected traffic channel on the GSM-MF and localize the target through
directing the aerial to the maximum signal level. Thereby the absolute reception
field strength will be shown on the display. Relative field strength is signaled
through changing tone pitch or intermitted sound (according to audio settings).
4.1 Mode menu
Manual mode (hand)
In manual mode, a reception level, which has to be within the preset range of the
measuring window, corresponds to the respective audio signal or intermitted
sound. Thus, increase and decrease in reception field strength can be discerned.
Automatic mode (auto)
In automatic mode, the strongest audio signal or intermitted sound is constantly
synchronized on the highest reception level measured. Audio signals or intermitted
sound will decrease at lower reception levels. Therefore, optimum position of the
aerial has to be controlled constantly.
4.2 SET menu
Change of audio signal or intermitted sound is realized for one adjustable
measuring window each. If the reception level is above or below the sensitivity
level set for the measuring window, further changes of the signal will not occur. To
continue direction finding, adjust settings for the measuring window accordingly.
Manual adjustment of measuring window (hand)
Press the "S" key [12] to select either the medium audio signal (manual mode) or
the maximum value (automatic mode). Instead of the “S” key [12], the remote
control, which is included in the scope of delivery, may be equally used.

Automatic adjustment of measuring window (auto)
In SET menu’s automatic mode, the medium audio signal (manual mode) or the
maximum value (automatic mode) is selected automatically, when the lower or
upper limit set for the measuring window is reached.
