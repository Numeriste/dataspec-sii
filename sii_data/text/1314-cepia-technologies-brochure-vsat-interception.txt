SatProbe 4000 VSAT
lnterception IP Probe
Affordable
Powerful
~lexible
State-of-the-art
Future-proof COTS and SDR architecture
Multiple VSAT system protocols, e.g.:
o DVB-RCS
o ViaSat
o iDirect
The SP4000 provides state-of-the-art VSAT
network interception from the forward and
return links. The software radio architecture
and the user-friendly design enables IP
packet capture from operational networks
provided by major VSAT manufactures, such
as DVB-RCS, ViaSat and iDirect networks.
SP4000 may start as a small single
protocol system and then be expanded to
multiple protocols and multiple carriers.

Technical Description

lntercepted IP stream

The SP4000 consists of:
Capture Front End
Controller
Signal Processing Array
The Capture Front End is a Software
Defined Radio with an integrated wideband
receiver, performing:
Downconversion from L-band (or IF)
Analogue to digital conversion
Channel filtering
Multiple Capture Front Ends may be connected to the same system, allowing flexible
carrier selection from different transponders.
The Controller performs:
System management and control
IP assembly from the
DVB-SlS2 receiver card
Distribution of the digitized capture
stream to the RL decoders
Collection of the decoded bursts
from the decoder processes
FL and RL IP assembly

The flexible and scalable architecture
allows flexible and user-friendly configuration and management of multiple frequencies and multiple VSAT protocols.
The Signal Processing Array performs the
demodulation and decoding of TDMA bursts
and return the resulting burst payloads to
the Controller.
