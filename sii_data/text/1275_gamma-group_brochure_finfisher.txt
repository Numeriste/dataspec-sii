Technological evolution
Changes in cyber technologies have led to new ways
of communication amongst criminal suspects.

Investigators are increasingly facing technological
challenges such as

• Encryption technologies
• Password protection
> Anti virus software and intrusion detection systems
• High degree of international mobility
• Use of anonymizing technologies
• Suspects with intrusion know how
• Variety of operating systems and devices

Traditional investigation methods are not sufficiently effective
to bring operations to a successful closure.

of communication.
