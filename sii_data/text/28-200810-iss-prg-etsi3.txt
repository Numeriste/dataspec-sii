Why Lawful Interception implementation in EU
17th January 1995: EU Council of Ministers
adopted resolution COM 96/C329/01 on Lawful Interception

The providers of public telecommunications networks and services
are legally required to make available to the authorities the
information necessary to enable them to investigate
telecommunications

Why standardisation of LI handling
q Easier to define own LI mechanism
" Guidance is given for network architecture
" No need to define/invent complete own LI system
" National options are possible

q :;3ea<er= LI <ro>uc2s
" Manufacturers need to develop one basic product
" National options are additional

q Intercepted result is meeting international requirements by
Law Enforcement Agencies
q LI Standards in ETSI/TC LI are actively developed in good
harmonization and are approved by all involved parties
