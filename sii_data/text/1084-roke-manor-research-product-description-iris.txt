Image Processing enhances Security
capabilities by detecting incidents,
recognising items, tracking people
and objects and reading numberplates
and other characters_
The Image Processing capabilities of
Roke Manor Research will provide a
solution to fit the requirements.
We've built systems, developed
custom solutions, carried out studies,
researched and developed algorithms.

Iris - effective and flexibleANPRusing personal computer hardware

los is an Automatic Number Plate
Reader fANPRl based on a standard
PC platform and low-cost multimedia
video capture board.
End users can now exploit the
benefits of teal-time automatic vehicle
dentification without incurfing the
premium hardware costs of existing
systems,
This ANPR has been designed to
operate with video from conventional
or lft-ilturnineted cameras.
With vehicle detection generated
from the video signal itself, the
system is ideally stilted to compact,
covert and mobile roadside
applications.

Iris/Access Control Typical Configuration

kis can be linked to a database to store dateis
vehicle movements.

Applications
Iris ANPR is a flexible tool which can
be used in a range of applications

flign

• Access control
• Security

• Traffic monitoring
• Route surveys
• Speed and licence enforcement
• Customer information and signage
Iris can also be extended to perform
recognition of other identification
marks, such as container codes and
railway rolling stock.
Iris' low cost makes it suitable where
budgetary constraints may have
prevented ANPR installation in the
past - such as rat-run surveys, smaller
industrial and office sites, hospitals,
supermarkets - as well as in major
systems such as motorway
installations and high-value security.

The standard Iris processing platform

Iris is being used at several
operational sites in Europe for access
control and traffic monitoring.

• Matrox Meteor video capture card

Features
Iris features include
• Fully automatic and fast operation
• Standard video input
• Low-cost hardware platform
• Single or multi-national plate sets

Because very efficient processing
algorithms are used, modest
processors are adequate for most
applications. Results can be delivered
within 0.2 sec on a 1E6 MHz Pentium
processor, sufficient for motorwayspeed traffic. Other PC-based
configurations are possible it special
processing is required.
Iris configuration can be performed
remotely using any office PC or laptop
with an ethernet port, running
Windows 95 or NT
• System Interfaces
Video input may be colour or
monochrome in NTSC, PAL, RS470,
CCIR formats. Each processor chassis
can take up to 4 simultaneous video
inputs

• Vehicle detection from video or
from externally generated signal

ANPR data can be stored or output on

• Windows-style graphical user
interlace for minimal configuration
time

• serial or ethernet ports for
communication or display

• local log files

Two specific examples illustrate Iris'
use as a black box component and as
an integrated part of a bespoke
system.

FrontDoor access control system

simply transmits ANPR readings to
the F rontDoor, which performs
database searches and controls
barriers and a sign. This system
allows Rpke Manor Research's
staff to come and go freely, while
unexpected visitors have to stop at
the gate to receive directions from
security staff.

system developed for the Dutch

agents or distributors who are
specialists in particular applications.

Iris may be provided in a number of
forms, ranging from pre-installed on a
processing platform to installed and
set up on customer's hardware. After

performed remotely using dial-up
facilities.
Iris is licenced on a per-camera basis
