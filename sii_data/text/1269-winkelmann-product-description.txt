CONFIGURATION
For ease of use the HAWK
XTS-2500 has an integral
extendable arm that can be
adj usted without interrupting
a search. The arm can be
quickly extended to search
for targets that have been
placed in ceilings or buried in
the ground.

The HAWK XTS-2500 is a portable, simple to
use advanced Electronic Device Detector,
also known as a Non-Linear Junction
Detector (NLJD).
The HAWK XTS-2500 is capable of locating
and confirming the presence of electronic
components found in devices, regardless
whether they are switched on or off.
The HAWK XTS-2500 allows the operator
to search voids and areas where they are
unable to gain physical or visual access,
in order to detect electronic components
and determine if the area is free from
"bugging devices" or an Improvised
Explosive Device (IED).
The HAWK XTS-2500 is lightweight, utilizes
modern technology shaped to allow easy
handling; single -body design containing
transceiver, antenna and display assembly
on a single extendible unit.
The HAWK XTS-2500 gives both audible
and visual alarms to allow the operator to
conduct searches in a covert environment.
During the life of the HAWK XTS-2500 it
may be deployed on a range of domestic
operations such as technical surveillance
countermeasures (TSCM), sweeps and noncombat operations such as peacekeeping
missions, and on civil emergency tasks,
where it can provide RCIED/IED search-andsupport to react to terrorism threats.

Technology
The HAWK XTS NLJD is used for the
detection of electronic circuits commonly
found in IEDs and radio transmitters. Most
sophisticated electronic circuits contain
semi conductors, which are non-linear
junctions. The HAWK XTS can find these
by emitting a very high frequency signal
which simulate the non linear junction into
emitting harmonic signals at two and three
times the fundamental frequency. The XTS
contains two highly sensitive receivers to
pickup these harmonic frequencies and
indicates the proximity of the device by
means of a visual and audible alarm.

ADVANTAGESOF25GHz
The higher frequency of the XTS-2500 detector has an
advantage on well-screened targets such as mobile
phones and similar devices. The smaller waveform
at 2.SGHz makes it more likely for the signal to
get through gaps in the screening enclosure
of the electronic device.

Training
Winkelmann and its Partners are able to offer
full training in the operation of products
together with general countermeasures
tra ining and seminars (Contact us about
