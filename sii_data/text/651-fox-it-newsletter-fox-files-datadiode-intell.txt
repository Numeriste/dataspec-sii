The Hypocrisy of Ethical Hacking
lt seems such an interesting idea: 'ethical' hackers who guard
our vulnerable data bases containing privacy-sensitive data .
Surely there is no objection to that?

The Netherlands' so-called 'Lektober' (literally, leaky October) in
2011 witnessed a number of incidents and demonstrated that data
security needs to be improved in our country. lt was a wake-up call.
After that, Robin Hood stories about hacks moved from tech news
to the front pages.
Fortunately the appreciation for ethical hackers has grown.
However, they still run the risk of being prosecuted . Even if a
hacker himself believes he is engaged in ethical work, the affected
companies and the law often hold a different view.
Two issues recently hit the headlines. At two medical institutions
in the Netherlands, the 'Groene Hart' hospital and 'Diagnostiek
voor U', patient details became accessible to hackers, who sought
publicity through the media. ln both instances the Public Prosecutor opted to institute legal proceedings. On first glance, this
appears to turn the world upside down: if someone made a mistake
here, then surely it was the organizations which were negligent in
safeguarding the details of their clients?
There is certainly something to be said for that. But on doser examination the hackers appear to be less ethical than thought. ln the
case of the hospital, the hacker went straight to the media rather
than to the hospital itself. Ethical hackers raised a number of questions about the time between discovery and notification, the means
used and the volume of data which was stolen. At 'Diagnostiek voor
U', Dutch MP Henk Krol broke into an Electronic Health Record
using a stolen password. He looked up friends in the data base,
COLOPHON

and soon after notifying the organization he approached the media .

The Specialist Investigation Vehicle (SIV) also incorporates
Fox-1r's Tracks Inspecter, software with which tactical
investigators can read digital evidence material relatively
easily. With Tracks Inspecter the tactical investigator has
direct access to the digital information and can apply
relevant findings immediately in the investigation at the
crime scene. Cooperation with the Specialist Investigation Vehicle in Twente thus also appeared to be a good
combination. Tracks Inspecter is user-friendly, intuitive
and runs in a web browser. This is exactly what the tactical
investigator needs to be able to conduct digital investigation easily himself

Vacant: the CCO position
Ad Scheepbouwer joined FOX-IT in October 2012 as a member
of the board and as a shareholder. With his experience in the
boardrooms of major exchange-listed companies, he is unrivalled in knowing just how the rabbits run there. Now it is time
that sly foxes enter the boardrooms, he proposes, turning their
eyes and their thoughts to cybersecurity. Where are the Chief
Cybersecurity Officers?

lt used to be sa id of generals that they were always busy with the
previous war. You certainly can't say that about the cyberso ldiers who
protect our computer networks. lt is in fact their ambition to always
be a step ahead of the hackers. How might they be able to infiltrate
