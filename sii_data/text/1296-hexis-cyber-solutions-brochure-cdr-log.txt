CDR Log Analytics and Retentio

-ith t . „ , a RetuAltior ''rective LAAsy

Communications providers generate hundreds of millions of event records daily. Every phone call placed,
connected, disconnected, etc. creates potentially critical event log data. Because of this, regulatory and
business drivers now require telecommunications providers to capture and retain years of this data.
Hells helps communications organizations around the world to quickly implement CDR log analytics and
retention solutions that uniquely deliver actionable results from massive amounts of log and event data.

High Performance Analytics
and Efficient F a c i e
Telecommunications providers capture and retain years of
CDR data for multiple purposes:
• Operations troubleshooting and root-cause analysis
• Fraud detection
• Forensics and investigations
• Anti-terror information requests
• Regulatory compliance
As an example, the EU Retention Directive specifies that
the following data elements be captured and retained in an
accessible repository for 6 - 24 months:
• Wireline/wireless Call Detail Records (CDRs)
• SMS Logs
• Email Logs
• Proxy Server Logs
• DHCP Assignment Logs
In many cases, this results in billions of records, and
terabytes of total data, to maintain and manage. In addition,
telecommunication providers must implement the capability
to perform pin-point searches over the full repository to
retrieve specific records.

i he ' : i s Approz
To effectively manage these requirements, an entirely new
approach is required. Hexis combines enterprise-class
software with regulatory and security proficiency, to provide
organizations the most efficient and cost-effective means of
collecting, analyzing and storing massive amounts of event
data regardless of the type or number of data sources to
be monitored. This translates to more accurate and efficient
security monitoring, investigations, digital forensics and
field-proven regulatory compliance. Hexis offers the
following benefits:
• Captures all CDR and log records from relevant sources
• Stores years of data online with immediate access to
all data
• Provides full data analysis capability - easy to extract the
exact records of interest
• Offers exceptional data loading and querying performance
Hexis dramatically reduces the cost of deployment and
ongoing management associated with security monitoring,
investigation and compliance. Hexis's patent-pending
technology yields a robust, high-speed, extensible CDR
retention and analysis solution.

Hexis provides telecommunication providers with the
most scalable means to centrally aggregate, efficiently
analyze, dynamically monitor and cost-effectively manage
high-volumes of event log data. Hexis is built upon
a modular architecture that takes full advantage of
parallel processing, and a clustered repository assuring
consistent event collection, analysis and availability. This
modular approach allows for appliance-like deployment,
distributed configuration, and high performance.

data analysis. The core
of the Hexis system is the
Hexis
Scalable Log Server (SLS).
Telecommunication Solution
It provides a scalable,
high-speed analytic repository that parses, compresses and
executes built-n and user-supplied queries against stored
event log data Hexis achieves a 10:1 raw log compression
rate, while maintaining full access to all the data for adhoc and scheduled analysis. Overall alert monitoring,
reporting, investigation and administration are provided
by the Analyzer through an intuitive web-based interface.
The solution is complemented by analytics packages of
pre-defined rules and reports, mapped to common security
monitoring guidelines and compliance standards.

Convert Years of Data into Actionabl W i t h i n Mi
Hexis eliminates the need for organizations to make
operational and compliance compromises with regard to
which systems to monitor, which data to collect, and how
long to utilize and retain event data online. Hexis's
purpose-built data store does not rely on relational
database management system (RDBMS) technology. This
results in more cost-effective data retention, as well as high
performance reporting and analysis. Hexis customers
analyze years and gigabytes worth of information
considerably faster, and with more precision and consistent
results than do their counterparts relying on RDBMS-based
systems. Hexis's optimized data store also avoids the
high administrative costs associated with managing an
RDBMS architecture. Finally, having access to years of
data online also eliminates tedious sub-dataset queries
and labor-intensive archive restoration processes. Hexis
benefits include:
• Leverage content addressed storage to yield
enterpriseclass security analytics
• Manage volumes of event data to reduce threat, violation
and privacy risks
• Streamline operational reporting and automate audit
processes
• Accelerate compliance efforts and address data retention
guidelines
• Reduce log management storage, archive, administration
and growth costs
• Readily expand capacity, performance and availability
with appliance-like deployment convenience
