A flood of unstructured data & information
More than 80% of the knowledge on which our daily jobs are
based is unstructured (emails, documents, web pages, articles,
information from social media, etc.).

The limits of traditional approaches
Keyword Technology
or Statistics
Breaks text into single words
without considering the
context, like reading a
language that we don t
understand:
Az IBM szokásosan nagy hangsúlyt
helyez a továbbképzésre, így
munkatársai évente számos szakmai
tanfolyamon vesznek részt.

Shallow Linguistic
Technology
Recognizes words and identifies
their most basic forms
(lemmas), but cannot
distinguish between different
meanings.
Sell -> Selling -> Sold

Neither understands the meaning of words.

4

Why we are different
Semantic technology understands the meaning of
words in the same way you learned to read.
•  It understands the relationships
between words.
Luke (subject) has eaten (verb)
a chicken (object).
•  It understands the meaning of
words.
To eat (chicken); to consume
(oil); to destroy (sweater); to
spend (money); to rust (the
tower), etc.

Where semantic technology excels

One keyword,
many
different meanings.
Over 231 million
results
for a single query.

6

The problem of text analysis
Same word,
different
meanings

Different words,
but the same
meanings

Different words,
related
meanings

Jaguar (animal)
Jaguar (car)

Disability Legislation
Equal Opportunity Law

Organization à Company
Organization à Charity
Organization à Trade Union

The semantic net, the heart of Cogito
Traditional technologies can only guess the meaning of words
using keywords, shallow linguistics and statistics.
Instead, semantic networks can identify:
Terms
Abbrev.

“San Jose is an
American city.”

Concepts
Connections

Phrases

Meanings
Domains

“San Jose is a
geographic part
of California.”
