5. PUBLIC SAFETY SYSTEMS NETWORK SECURIZATION

5.1.YOUR SYSTEM, DESCRIPTION OF EXISTING ARCHITECTURE
You will find below your existing architecture:

In this network architecture, there are six remote sites and some remote users which must be linked to the
central main system. The main system is located in Tripoli; the other sites are away from the town from 30 to
100 kms.
The data transmission between the sites is done by dial-up connection. The data rate is 33.6 kbits/s.
The central site is composed of BDC and PDC servers, a BLT Backup, a RAID system, archiving servers,
and user with PCs in the Local Area Network. All of those are linked by optical fiber. In the main central site,
you use 3Com 3300 switches and Cisco 2600 Routers.
All the remote sites are composed by a Compaq server and a LAN of PCs. Again, here you use 3Com 3300
switches. In each site there are 3 to 10 PCs. The PCs are Pentium 4 running under Windows 2000 Server.
The server of each remote site is in fact a partial replication of the central data base.
The remote users, who want to connect to the central sites are only using their PCs. In this case, there is no
server.
The transfer of information is always done from the remote sites to the central system. Remote sites are
upgrading main data base but never in the other way. For the data transmission, protocol used is standard
TCP-IP.
5.2.IDENTIFICATION OF SECURITY PROBLEM

9

20060512TP-HOSP
Ind. 02

Homeland Security Program
Technical Specification

Today, all the data transmission between the different sites is done without any encryption or protection. That
is to say that a hacker can intercept the flow of data transmitted and access to confidential information.
What is more, a hacker may also try to enter illegally in the LAN of remote or main sites. If he can do this,
he will also have an easy access to the information.
To protect you from all these threats, we will propose to you the solution described below
5.3.OUR PROPOSED SOLUTION
5.3.1.I2E VPN: CRYPTO-TUNNEL
As far as remote secure network access is concerned, i2e offers 2 solutions:
- CryptoWALL Crypto-Tunnel Clients-Server
- CryptoWALL Crypto-Tunnel Point to Point
Crypto-Tunnel Clients-Server establishes secure connections between a server, generally located in the
branch office of your company, and the remote workstations, which need a link to the Local Area Network
(LAN). This software solution has been designed to open an access to your company LAN for your coworkers from all over the world. Everyone can share all kind of information with high security.
Crypto-Tunnel Point to Point is a software solution designed to establish an encrypted communication
tunnel between two or more remote office. This tunnel uses existing physical network, such as Internet, and
its purpose is to secure all data flows transmitted between different sites of the same company.
5.3.2.COMMON FEATURES
Strong authentication by ECC signature – Unique in the world
Thanks to a key exchange protocol based on Elliptic Curve technology, Crypto-Tunnel increases the
security of the authentication process.
Elliptic Curve technology offers the most powerful cryptographic protections of nowadays for a few reasons:
-

Due to new ECC mathematical models, classical ways used to break RSA or DSA algorithms do not
work

-

Computing time with elliptic curves decreases

-

Elliptic curve keys use less memory compared with RSA keys for the same strength of protection.
For instance, encrypting with a 128 bits key ECC is as strength as a 1024 bits key RSA. Thus, ECC
suits very well smart cards needs or weak memory environments

10

20060512TP-HOSP
Ind. 02

Homeland Security Program
Technical Specification

Compliant with European and international norms.
Crypto-Tunnel is in accordance with European and international standards, relative to IT security which
guarantee compatibility and upgradeability of its solutions: digital certificate in X509 V3 for authentication,
signature with elliptic curves (ECDSA) …

5.3.3.SPECIFIC FEATURES
5.3.3.1.CRYPTOWALL CRYPTO-TUNNEL CLIENTS-SERVER
The Crypto-Tunnel system provides secure data transmission between a local network and client
remote workstations, wherever they are.
Access to encrypted data running on the network will be impossible for hackers or intruders. An encrypted
point to point link is established between branch office and mobile stations whatever transmission media is
used: Ethernet, WIFI, Bluetooth, IRDA …
Crypto-Tunnel acts as a firewall to prevent any kind of intrusion
The client workstation software is integrated into Microsoft Windows kernel to control and protect all input
and output network flows. So, during a secure communication, all network ports are closed except the
encrypted one.
The server software also features an intrusion detection technology. It makes your server more secure and
insensitive to attacks like: Man-in-the-middle, rebound attacks, Spoofing, Flooding, etc.
Smart card authentication
To use the client, one needs a smart card USB key potected by PIN to open the tunnel with the remote server.
This smart card contains personal data needed to authenticate oneself and used to establish a personal secure
communication with the server.
5.3.3.2.CRYPTOWALL CRYPTO-TUNNEL POINT TO POINT
CryptoWALL Crypto-Tunnel Point to Point offers a high level of security to interconnect distant offices
and business partners by creating a secure tunnel through Internet independent from the physical media
crossed: Ethernet, WIFI, Bluetooth, IRDA, …
Thanks to this software, data are always encrypted on the network, and cannot be read. A hacker can never
intercept critical data from your company. You work with optimal security.
No specific configuration is required and the system is transparent for users. Each user keeps his or her usual
working comfort. Crypto-Tunnel Point to Point provides secure use of all standards applications: Mail,
Internet, voice communication, Videoconference or any other dedicated application. The system provides
secure exchange of any type of critical data and protects integrity of the company data.
Crypto-Tunnel acts as a firewall to prevent any kind of intrusion
Whatever encryption algorithm chosen, Crypto-Tunnel Point to Point features an intrusion detection
technology. It makes your server more secure and insensitive to attacks like: Man-in-the-middle, rebound
attacks, Spoofing, Flooding, etc.
5.3.4.THE NEW ARCHITECTURE
To protect all your data transmission between the sites, we will install the Crypto-Tunnel technology in each
site (remote and central) and for every remote user allowed to use the central resources.

11

20060512TP-HOSP
Ind. 02

Homeland Security Program
Technical Specification

You will find the new network architecture below:

The installation of the solution will be very easy, because it consists, for sites, in the insertion of our
encryption-decryption Crypto-Tunnel server in your existing architecture. That is to say that you need 7 (6
remote sites + 1 central site) Crypto-Tunnel Point to Point servers.
For remote user, it only consists in installing Crypto-Tunnel Client-Server software on his computer and
giving him a smart card, so that he can be authenticated by the central server. Here, you need one CryptoTunnel Client licence for each remote user connected.
The entire securization will not imply any modification in your network, it will remain easy to deploy and
easy to use. After deployment, you will continue working with the same software as before. The securization
layer will be transparent for end users. They will keep all their working comfort, without changing any of
their habits.

5.4.SECURIZATION OF EACH PC: PC PROTECT
PC-Protect is a software solution allowing the creation of safe boxes on your computer or external drives.
With this software and with your smart card, you will create volume (seen in Windows as virtual local
drives) that only you will be able to open. The volume is encrypted by your personal key stored in your
smart card and decrypted in real-time when you need to access to the confidential information.
With only one software installed on your computer, you will be able to create as many volumes as you want
and on every kind of physical support (Flash USB Key, Local drive, CD-ROM, Network server …).
Then all your datas will be encrypted in every PC of your network.
For more information about this product, you will find the data sheet in Annex 3.

5.5.SECURIZATION OF YOUR MAIL: MAIL-PROTECT
Mail-Protect is a software used to protect the email you send and receive. This software encrypts and sign
(with digital signature and certificates) your confidential emails. The encryption and signature protects you
against intercepting and reading your email, modifying them during transfer and assures you that the sender
is really the one he pretends to be.
Al these protections are provided by the use of the smart card. You can use the same smart card if you are
already a PC-Protect user. In your smart card will be stored your secret keys used for encryption.
For more information about this product, you will find the data sheet in Annex 4.
5.6.EXISTING SOLUTION PROVIDED BY I2E
All these solution have already been provided by i2e Technologies to the French Army, to the French
Ministry of Defence and to some French big accounts.
5.7.PLANNING
After approval for exportation, the delivery will be within 4 months.

6. MOBILE PHONE ENCRYPTION AND PROTECTION
6.1.ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS
Their are different techniques to encrypt a conversation over a mobile phone (GSM, GPRS, ...).
Encryption Method
The robustness of the encryption lies first on the quality of the mathematical algorithm used to
encrypt. As mentioned before only the elliptical curves (ECC) give a total reliability whereas the
RSA/AES models are proven to be easily breakable.
I2E is the only source to offer the ultimate ECC encryption over mobile.
I2E phones are the only one to assure a totally reliable and confidential phone conversation.
Communication canal:
Beside the encryption method, the way to transport the encrypted signal is also critical. The only
valid ones are using the data canal of the link. Of this category, all are using the data canal of the
GSM link. This method has three serious problems:
a)the speed of the data canal on the GSM is extremely limited, which means that, unless the
signal strenght is excellent and the quality of the connection is also excellent,
communication are often broken or scattered. By the same token, international
communication are rendered difficult.
b)The second drawback of this method is its inherent cost since the communication are
invoiced by the amonut of information on the data canal and not by the communication time.
The GSM data canal is very expensive.
c)The last drawback is the cost of these individual phones added to the fact that only two
exact same phones can communicate together.
I2E encrypted phones (CTOP) are totally different. They are using the ultimate techniques.
a) First CTOP phones are the only one with ECC encryption method.
b) Second, only these are also using the GPRS communication canal, which is by definition
designed for data transmittion. Capacity of this canal is far greater than the GSM data canal.
It means that it allows information redundancy and avoids scattered or broken
communications.
c) Third, the cost of data transfer over GPRS is by far less costly than GSM data transfer.
Costs of communication will then be cheaper.
d)Lastly, cost of the encrypted phones is limited to the cost of the software that is added on
the smart phone that the user already has. It is also, by definition, easy to change phones
after, since these products evolve very rapidly.

Technical Specification

6.2.THE EXISTING SYSTEM: C-TOP – SECURE MOBILE PHONES
6.2.1.VOICE PROTECTION OVER GPRS
2 CTOP users can communicate with VoIP over GRPS in full confidence. All their conversations are strongly
encrypted. CTOP is a Windows Mobile application over QTEK 9100 smart phone under Windows CE 5.0.

6.2.2.SIMPLICITY AND HIGH SECURITY
Whole CTOP security is entirely transparent to users. No knowledge in cryptography or IT security matters
is needed to use it. CTOP is very easy and comfortable to use. Nevertheless, easiness does not mean low
security, since CTOP protection is based on the ultra robust technology of elliptic curves cryptography.
Elliptic curves technology provides security for:
- authenticating strongly CTOP users
- creating encryption key for each communication
- encrypting communications between CTOP Terminals. Thus, encryption algorithm is single and
really strong.
6.2.3.ARCHITECTURE OF CTOP
Architecture is composed of:
- CTOP terminals (GPRS terminals)
- One CTOP server (on the Internet)

6.2.4.CTOP TERMINAL

15

20060512TP-HOSP
Ind. 02

Homeland Security Program
Technical Specification

The CTOP Terminal is used for :
- connecting to other CTOP Terminals
- communicating in full confidence with secured VoIP
An intuitive GUI enables CTOP users to:
- dial and call other CTOP users
- save numbers, contacts in CTOP directory
- manage missed calls or called number
- manage classic phone features (micro or audio volume, calling number displaying, mute mode)
6.2.5.CTOP SERVER
This server is used for :
- connecting CTOP terminals between themselves
- enabling CTOP terminals to communicate despite the NAT GPRS providers problem
- blocking of stolen or lost CTOP terminals
- managing groups of CTOP users
- authenticating strongly CTOP terminals that aim to communicate
This server is strongly protected against all kinds of modern attacks such as Deny of Service or Man in the
Middle Attack for instance. Only a trusted administrator can access to this server with a security token
protected by a PIN code.
Besides, this server is designed to manage few hundreds CTOP communications in the same time. The
number of communications is dependant of the Internet broadband you give to this server.
Note: in this native solution it is infeasible to recover or decrypt communications between two CTOP
terminals.

16

20060512TP-HOSP
Ind. 02

Homeland Security Program
Technical Specification

6.3.THE SOLUTION WITH “MASTER KEY”
As we said before, the CTOP solution is unbreakable because:
- there is a strong authentication for the clients.
- the encryption algorithm is the best we can find now because based on elliptic curves.
Without lowering all this security features, we can provide you a CTOP system with a “master key” to
monitor all encrypted communications.
6.3.1.MAIN FEATURES
6.3.1.1.A MODULE FOR MONITORING COMMUNICATION
To answer to your needs, we can provide you a module that modifies the role of the server. In the new
system, we will give you a master key, which will be able to decrypt every CTOP audio conversation. This
key will be used on the CTOP central server, and with it, you will be able to listen to audio conversation
either in live or in differed time. The detailed use will be explained on the next scheme.
6.3.1.2.PROTECTION OF THE MASTER KEY
This key must be protected with very strong security policy; only authorized and accredited people will
have access to this key and to the room where the server stays. The key will also be protected by a twopeople access : “CTOP server” with Access Control by secret sharing system. This means that two different
people in charge with their own password must be present at the same time to use this system.
6.3.1.3.ROLE OF THE SERVER
The server will, in this solution, not only remain a network relay for all voice communication packets, but
also become a recorder for all encrypted communications. All the encrypted communications will be saved in
a database on the server with the decryption key, thus you will be able to listen to it live or to store it for later
use. With this module, you will also see who is communicating with whom in real-time, because each user is
authenticated on the central server.

17

20060512TP-HOSP
Ind. 02

Homeland Security Program
Technical Specification

6.3.1.4.GENERAL SCHEME OF WORK

6.3.2.TECHNICAL DETAILS
For end-users, there will be no difference when they use the normal or the modified solution.
In terms of security, the “master key” is also called a recovery key, because anyone in possession of this one
can recover all encrypted information.
Technically, each communication is encrypted with a different secret key. In the modified solution, this secret
key will, in fact, be readable for the owner of the master key. The secret key of each communication will be
recorded in the central CTOP Server just like the entire communication. This solution is the best we can
provide to answer to your need, because it offers you a way to monitor encrypted communication either live
or in deferred time.

6.4.PLANNING
After approval for exportation, the delivery will be within 5 months

7.3.GSM MONITORING
We consider three ways of using the distant GSM to monitor the conversation or activity being held at the
GSM location. One is cooperative (the GSM holder is aware that the GSM is used as a remote microphone)
and the two others are tm-cooperative.
7.3.l.REMOTE COOPERATDTE MODIFIEp GSM

This GSM is a modified GSM with a super sensitive inicrophone which allows capturing all conversations in
the room. It is used with full awareness of owner as a remote microphone.

20

20060512TP-HOSP
Ind. 02

Homeland Security Program
Technical Specification

While listening and transmitting conversation, the GSM remains in an apparent “OFF” mode, preventing
suspicion.
The GSM listening mode is activated remotely by authorized GSM phone and is stopped the same way.
Conversation lasts as long as battery is available.
Enclose in our proposal are 3 telephones of this kind.

7.3.2.REMOTE UNCOOPERATIVE MODIFIED GSM
This GSM is a modified GSM. It is “offered” to its owner without his (or her) awareness that it has been
modified. It allows capturing conversations within proximity of the GSM phone by calling on a silent mode
and with password the modified GSM.

The GSM listening mode is activated remotely by authorized GSM phone and using special code so that the
owner doesn’t realise that is phone is emitting and is stopped the same way.
Conversation lasts as long as battery is available.
It requires the phone to be “on stand by” mode to be triggered and will not work if the phone is off or if the
battery is removed or if the SIM card is changed.
Enclose in our proposal are 3 telephones of this kind.
7.3.3.REMOTE UNCOOPERATIVE UNMODIFIED GSM
This GSM is not a hardware modified GSM. The objective of this development programme is to be able to
trigger phones of selected persons and be able to listen to their discussions using their GSM phone as a
microphone and without their awareness. It will allow capturing conversations within proximity of the GSM
phone by calling on a silent mode though the listening equipment.

7.6.PORTABLE LOCATOR FOR GSM MOBILE TERMINAL.

This product is based on GSM base station simulation technology. It allows to detect and to save in a
database all the GSM mobiles that are present in a user selectable area, for example a hotel, a building or an
airport.
At the setup, the system generates a coverage area which varies depending of the transmitted power (1 W to
16 W) and the BTS proximity. Then, all the mobile terminals that are in this area for 15 to 60 seconds
(depending of the mobile terminal type) are detected and their International Mobile Subscriber Identity –
IMSI- and International Mobile Equipment Identity –IMEI saved in a database.

Operator can change the covered area by regulating output power. If the transmit power with 1W is not
enough to cover the area, it can be connected to a frequency power amplifier and antenna amplifier.
Generally, in city the coverage area can reach from 10 to 100 meters and from 50m to 2km in suburb.
During all the process, the use of the GSM terminal is affected during the 2 to 10 first seconds, and this only
for the incoming calls. After this period, the GSM mobile works normally.

7.7.PLANNING
After approval for exportation (T0 ), the delivery will be:
a) T0+1 month for the remote cooperant MODIFIED GSM
b) T0+1 month for the remote uncooperative MODIFIED GSM
c) T0+7 months for the remote uncooperative UNMODIFIED GSM

8.1.GENERAL PRESENTATION
Network Stream Analyser, NSA, is an Internet network monitoring equipment.
It is mainly designed to monitor all internet traffic and intercept those mails that may content information
relevant to the Public Safety System Organisation.
The whole system is designed to be absolutely passive, connected on internet via the main Libyan ISP with
its approval, and without any disruption on his installation. The System is also undetectable by any Internet
Users.
The system will be connected on the 1Gbit/s Ethernet connection between the switch CISCO catalyst 6000
and the main router which is a CISCO serie 7500 (to be upgraded in the next months) thanks to an optical tap
from the company Netoptics (see attached document, annex #A), allowing no disrupt of traffic in case of
default, the traffic will continue even if our equipment is not working.
The first step of our system is to go through a very powerful PROBE which is able to process a 1Gbit/s flow
in real time (real time on the whole 1Gbit/s), this probe is composed of plug-in modules, each module being
able to process 200Mbit/s of datas, Those modules are easily replaceable and are hot plug (plug and play).
This probe has a special software which is doing discrimination of the internet flow in different categories:
mail (including webmail, instant messaging, etc.) , HTTP, VoiP, business type (VPN, citrix, etc.), video, etc.
The recognition is done through this special software (CAPI-FC) which can recognize up to 250 of the most
used protocols, those ones are recognised thanks to unique software whose recognition is based on key word
and syntax within the protocol. Then the internet flow is sent to a big DATA BASE in as many files as main
topics, that means that there will be a file for all the mail types, another one for VoIP, etc.
The transfers of the datas will be done through an optical fiber, so we will be able to locate the data base in
the monitoring center for security reason, the only equipment located in the ISP will be the probe and the
data base server, the data base disks will be in the monitoring center.
This software can be up graded easily as every protocols recognition is done through “plug in” software
modules and another new module can be added very easily. Right now, we can guarantee more than 70%
recognition of the internet flow.
We will assist the customer in adding new protocols recognition to achieve this goal of 70% by adding new
protocol plug in if necessary with a target of 90% recognition.

The created files will then be stored in a very big data base server of 12To, which will give you the available
amount of space to store up to more than 50 days according to the relevant information of LTT, based on the
today’s traffic (60% average load on the STM1 optical link).
At the same time, the powerful probe is taking a number of information called “attributes” for all the
recognized protocols, the software doing that is call CAPI-FM , like Flow Monitor. For each protocol, we
will have several attributes, for example:

–

SMTP: sender, receiver, subject, keyword, attachment type, …

–

GTP (mobile tunneling) L2TP (fixed network tunneling) : IMSI, MSISDN, called ID, etc…

–

WSP (wap): Agent, …

Radius: user, IP address, ...
Webmail: user, IP, subject, keyword, ...
It is very important to realise that all those attributes will be given in real time for all traffic (real time means
seconds and not minutes!).

Those attributes create a "CDR", like Call Data Records which is going to be stored in the same data base as
the complete flow. The data base is hence separated in two smaller data base, one being the CDR data base
with all the attributes associated with every protocols and another database with the complete traffic.
The filtering will be done based on those attributes, and then if necessary the complete data exchange will be
reconstitute (in differed time obviously) like complete email including attached files, VoIP session, chat ,
etc . ..

Those probes can be added in different places to handle more points of interception, they don't need to be cascaded,
then agglomerate traffic of several Gbit/s can be done, the datas will be then stored in the same data base. In conclusion
through this solution, the proposal can be expandable to 1OGbit/s of intercepted traffic, all the probes being placed on
1Gbit/s interface and then all the datas will feed the same data base.

8.3.THE DATA BASE
8.3.1.PRESENTATION
The state of the art data base server which is going to host the data will have a 12To disk capacity, organized in RAID 5
to secure the data, this server will be a versatile server with hot plug removable hard disk of at least 300Go with Fiber
channel SCSI interface (depending of technology evolution at the PO order).
The server will be located in the ISP premises and the disk array in the monitoring center for security reason. The link
between the two will be done through a 4GBit/s fiber channel solution with a maximum length of 10km (for the
proposal we have taken for granted that the optical fiber is already installed).

The proposed solution will have at least the detailed following specification (once again, it will depends of PO timing),
The solution will have a full 4GBit/s architecture end to end (from the server to the disk connection !) to handle the data
rate and will share the same storage management system.
The fiber channel technology will be used in the main server and through all the rack extension, this data base will be
installed with 12To of disk capacity and could be up graded up to 34To if necessary.
The disk will be FIBER CHANNEL SCSI type, 300Go each and running at 15000 r/m, the RAID controller

will be fully redundant and the server will be highly secure.
The main server will handle 16 disks and will be able to be connected up to 6 expansion units (EXP 810),
each of those units being able to handle also 16 disks.
The total capacity of the system for future evolution will be 34To.

8.4.THE MONITORING CENTER AND FILTERING

8.4.1.FIRST STEP: THE CDR DATA BASE

The monitoring center will be connected to the data base through a LAN. In the proposal, we have
included 10 PC to send queries to the MySQL data base. The system will be organized in two
operating modes :
1. The CDR constitution in real time
2. The reconstitution of all communications and/or data exchanges from the complete and total
monitored flow.
It will be possible to send queries to the CDR data base.
Those queries will allow the visualization of extracted information from the data base (CDR), the
reconstitution of the different applications or communications will be then done if necessary (don’t
forget that we store the complete and total flow).

32

20060512TP-HOSP
Ind. 02

Homeland Security Program
Technical Specification

For example, here is a CDR view of e-mail communication with selected attributes (not all):

If necessary, it will be possible to reconstitute the second complete email including the excel
spreadsheet if this e-mail address is of interest.
We can add and “filter” in this view other attributes like keyword warnings, domain names, etc…
Meaning that if we want to have all the email exchange with the word “france” inside, the above
view will have another column called keyword warning with the word “france” signifying that this
word is either in the email subject or in the text.
At this stage, if you are interested in the mail, the mail will be reconstituted with its attached
documents.
Here is another CDR view of e-mail communication with a specific targeted email sender:

Here is another CDR view of mail communication through MSN messenger instant messaging, if
one communication is interesting, then the complete communication could be reconstituted from the
complete flow database:

8.4.2.SECOND STEP: FLOW RECONSTITUTION

Once we have selected or recognised any information of interest thanks to the CDR database, all
information stored in the main data base can be reconstituted with the exception of storage
limitation of course (we remind you that we have in storage several days of the complete flow!).
Those reconstitutions called transcoding modules are organised by application type. All the kind of
emailing applications, attached documents, VoIP type of communication can be reconstructed.
Email type transcoding modules include:
- SMTP,
- POP3,
- IMap
- and webmail (the most and common used, google, yahoo, etc.)
Attached files to the communication exchanges:
- .doc, .txt, .xls, .csv, .pdf, .ppt, etc.
- .gif, .jpeg, .bmp, .mpeg, .avi, .tif, .wav, etc.
The most and common used VoIP and Chat type:
- Standardised ones (H323, SIP, MGCP, .)
- Proprietary ones (msn, yahoo, paltalk, bctocall, bctophone,etc.)
Once the user has decided to recreate the file of interest, this file will be available for editing,
printing or storing.
All the reconstructed files will be available for keyword searching in the document.

8.4.3.EXAMPLE OF OPERATIONAL MODE (NOT LIMITED TO)

Thanks to the of the system organization, different types of operational modes can be used:
♦ Specific keyword based monitoring
 In all emails send or received (in subject or in the text)
 In all types of attachment (txt, xls , csv ,pdf, ..) once the flow is reconstituted and on
a specific target
 Web site browsed (URL query)
 Chat message (inside the text)
♦ Email ID based monitoring
 Capture of all email and attachment
 Search for keyword within all captured mails and attachments (in differed time for
attached document)

For the past years, terrorists or unofficial threat organisations lead a lot of bombing attempts against VIP
Convoy using radio remote explosives. The important things to know are that a lot of radio communications
devices including mobile phones are not used in their primary utilisation but used to trigger explosives from
a remote and safe area. The recent dramatic news shows that it is very easy for indelicate persons to access
these devices mainly available on the unofficial market.

Our unique Mobile Jamming systems are made of advanced radio transmitters especially designed to
block radio-communication receivers in HF, VHF or UHF Bands (therefore including GSM, GPRS
or equivalent) in an area of about 1OOm around the mobile Jamming Car.

The systems creates all around the vehicle a high power radio-electrical shield that allows to saturate
all radio frequencies in a 1OOm radius, while preserving the health of all persons located inside the

9.2.3.6.POWER CONSUMPTION
The power peak indicated for each mode, offensive or defensive are about the same value. Nevertheless, the
differences between these two modes are related to the type of modulation. In defensive mode, the width of
pulsate is significant. The consumption of energy is high for a power RF overall identical to that of the
offensive mode (with narrower pulsate mode).
The overall consumption of the system takes into consideration the consumption of the drawers and
appendices of the system. It is globally higher than 3KVA.

10. DATA AND COMMUNICATION PROTECTION: PASSPORT NETWORK
10.1.YOUR SYSTEM, DESCRIPTION OF EXISTING ARCHITECTURE
You will find below your existing architecture:

In this network architecture, there is a main site with a data base centralizing all the information relative to
passports and an application server. There are also 37 points located all over the country. These points are for
example placed in the airport, in the harbours or at the border. In each point you will find a 28.8 kbps
modem, a router and a switch. The routers are Xyplex Network 3000. The modems are Multitech Modem.
Each point is linked to the central site with dial-up connection and the computers on the site can exchange
information with central database, to update it for example. The data rate is 28.8 kbits/s.

52

20060512TP-HOSP
Ind. 02

Homeland Security Program
Technical Specification

25 points are equipped with maximum 2 computers and the other 12 points have from 4 to 20 PCs. The
details of these points are presented below:
• Tripoli Airport: 20 PCs
• Tripoli Harbour: 4 to 5 PCs
• Tripoli (others) : 4 PCs
• Benghasi Airport : 10 PCs
• Benghasi Harbour : 3 to 4 PCs
• Tunisia Border Line (2 points): 3 + 2 = 5 PCs
• Egypt Border Line: 6 PCs
• Niger Border Line: 5 PCs
• Algeria Border Line: 5 PCs
• Tchad Border Line: 12 PCs
• Passport Management : 8 PCs
The quantity of data transmitted is very low, because each entry in the database is only composed of text
information about the person and its photo in JPEG format (approximatively 3kB).
The transfer of information is done in both ways: from the remote sites to the central system and the
opposite. For the data transmission, protocol used is standard TCP-IP.
10.2.IDENTIFICATION OF SECURITY PROBLEM
Today, all the data transmission between the different sites is done without any encryption or protection. That
is to say that a hacker can intercept the flow of data transmitted and access to confidential information.
What is more, a hacker may also try to enter illegally in the LAN of remote or main sites. If he can do this,
he will also have an easy access to the information.
To protect you from all these threats, we will propose to you the solution described below
10.3.OUR PROPOSED SOLUTION
10.3.1.I2E VPN: CRYPTO-TUNNEL
As far as remote secure network access is concerned, i2e offers one solution:
- CryptoWALL Crypto-Tunnel Point to Point
Crypto-Tunnel Point to Point is a software solution designed to establish an encrypted communication
tunnel between two or more remote office. This tunnel uses existing physical network, such as Internet, and
its purpose is to secure all data flows transmitted between different sites of the same company.

10.3.2.GENERAL FEATURES
Strong authentication by ECC signature – Unique

in the world

Thanks to a key exchange protocol based on Elliptic Curve technology, Crypto-Tunnel increases drastically
the security of the authentication process.
Elliptic Curve technology offers the most powerful cryptographic protections nowadays for a few
reasons:
-

Due to new ECC mathematical models, classical ways used to break RSA or DSA algorithms do not
work

-

Computing time with elliptic curves decreases

-

Elliptic curve keys use less memory compared with RSA keys for the same strength of protection.
For instance, encrypting with a 128 bits key ECC is as strength as a 1024 bits key RSA. Thus, ECC
suits very well smart cards needs or weak memory environments

Compliant with European and international norms.
Crypto-Tunnel is in accordance with European and international standards, relative to IT security which
guarantee compatibility and upgradeability of its solutions: digital certificate in X509 V3 for authentication,
signature with elliptic curves (ECDSA) …

10.3.3.SPECIFIC FEATURES
10.3.3.1.CRYPTOWALL CRYPTO-TUNNEL POINT TO POINT
CryptoWALL Crypto-Tunnel Point to Point offers a high level of security to interconnect distant offices
and business partners by creating a secure tunnel through Internet independent from the physical media
crossed: Ethernet, WIFI, Bluetooth, IRDA, … Thanks to this software, data are always encrypted on the
network, and cannot be read. A hacker can never intercept critical data from your company. You work with
optimal security.
No specific configuration is required and the system is transparent for users. Each user keeps his or her usual
working comfort. Crypto-Tunnel Point to Point provides secure use of all standards applications: Mail,
Internet, voice communication, Videoconference or any other dedicated application. The system provides
secure exchange of any type of critical data and protects integrity of the company data.
Crypto-Tunnel acts as a firewall to prevent any kind of intrusion
Whatever encryption algorithm chosen, Crypto-Tunnel Point to Point features an intrusion detection
technology. It makes your server more secure and insensitive to attacks like: Man-in-the-middle, rebound
attacks, Spoofing, Flooding, etc.
The main Crypto tunnel server located in the central office is a “super” server enabled to communicate with
all the distant remote office server.

10.3.4.THE NEW ARCHITECTURE
To protect all your data transmission between the sites, we will install the Crypto-Tunnel technology in each
site (remote and central).
You will find the new network architecture below:

The installation of the solution will be very easy, because it consists in the insertion of our encryptiondecryption Crypto-Tunnel server in your existing architecture between the switch and the router. That is to
say that you need 38 (37 remote offices + 1 central site) Crypto-Tunnel Point to Point servers.
On each site, the Crypto-Tunnel server is authenticated to the central server, so that no one can use the
secured transmission without authorisation. This authentication is done with a smartcard. Each CryptoTunnel server disposes of a unique smart card.
The entire securization will not imply any modification in your network, it will remain easy to deploy and
easy to use. After deployment, you will continue working with the same software as before. The securization
layer will be transparent for end users. They will keep all their working comfort, without changing any of
their habits.

10.4.SECURIZATION OF EACH PC: PC PROTECT
PC-Protect is a software solution allowing the creation of safe boxes on your computer or external drives.
With this software and with your smart card, you will create volume (seen in Windows as virtual local
drives) that only you will be able to open. The volume is encrypted by your personal key stored in your
smart card and decrypted in real-time when you need to access to the confidential information.
With only one software installed on your computer, you will be able to create as many volumes as you want
and on every kind of physical support (Flash USB Key, Local drive, CD-ROM, Network server …).
What we propose is the securization of all your datas on each PC you have, especially your main server
where you have your Data Base, the datas will be completely encrypted.
For more information about this product, you will find the data sheet in Annex 3.

10.5.EXISTING SOLUTION PROVIDED BY I2E
All these solution have already been provided by i2e Technologies to the French Army, to the French
Ministry of Defence and to some French big accounts.
10.6.PLANNING
After approval for exportation, the delivery will be within 3 months.
