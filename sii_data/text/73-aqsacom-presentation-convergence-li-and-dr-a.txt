High Level Requirements: Ll+DR
Law Enforcement & National Security Groups Need:
• A solution that allows them access and interrogate data from
LI and DR.
• Solutions that evolve to cover new and evolving services.
• A capability to configure and focus data for analysis.
• Tools that allow data to be mixed or repackaged as new
information is identified.
• Effective Development options.
• Secure Solutions.

Carrier/ISPs Need:
• Systems that meet National Requirements
• Solutions that don't inhibit products
• Cost effective approach.

Ll+DR
Two Core Partners for an integrated solution:
- The Carriers/ISP's
- The Agencies

Overall Solution must:
• Have an integrated architecture, CSP to LEA
•Compatible systems• Defined operating interfaces
• Defined Processes
•Effective
•Secure

• Agreed roadmaps

Roadmaps- Fix Today, Evolve into the Future
LI or DR solutions do not have to be 'Big-Bang'.
• Fix Todays Requirement
• Identify Evolution Requirements
• Ensure you have Flexibility and Scalability.
Objective is to invest in a solution that can grow and
evolve with the business for both:
• Carrier
• LEA
The 'business' on both fronts will change.

Data is being captured and stored for multiple
purposes:
• Action NOW- Life and Death
• Action Now- Case in progress
• Action now- Active Investigation
• Store- Possible interest
• Store for Future.

Storing and Mining Data
Given these 'Considerations':
Strategic Framework for Data storage:
• Prioritize/tag data in line with known search profiles.
• Store high priority data to enable instant and effective
. .
m1n1ng.
• Store low risk data in a way that balances cost with risk
assessment.

Invest in Solutions that achieve the business need- A

Data Storage Principles
• Data will be stored between 6 months and up to 3 years
(if following EU framework). Period varies depending
upon predetermined 'value' of data.
• Data is IRI+ for DR and IRl+CC for LI.
• Data captured and stored will have varying value, from
P1 to much lower priorities.
• Storing principles must allow effective mining.
• Anticipate large volumes of data, much of this 'low
value'.
• But, some 'low value' data may become 'interesting'
later- Must be able to retrieve and raise priority.

Data Flow Principles 1
• LEAs do need ALL high priority data. This may
include:
• LI related material
• Associates of people under active LI
• People on 'high interest' list.
This data is used for high priority Agency actions
and Agency analysis.
This is expected to be a low o/o of total available
data.

Data Flow Principles 2
Majority of stored data, all DR related, is for:
- General analysis looking for 'fits' against defined
criminal profiles.
- Held for potential later use if 'new' areas or
people of interest are identified.
This data is available to LEAs but doesn't drive
day-to-day high priority activities.

Action and Analysis -Principles 1

• LEA Treasure Chest:
• Known people and/or services
• Understanding of Criminal Actions (Profiles)
• LEA Stored Data for Analysis/Action
• LI- High Priority (P1)
• Target IRI- High Priority (P2)
• DR High Value Material- Medium Priority (P3)
This material drives direct LEA action and is used
for detailed profile analysis.
Material is stored using easy/quick access principles.

Action and Analysis- Principles 2
Stored Data at CSP/ISP:
• All data is DR related
• Data is classified 'Low Value', Priority P4 and P5
Due to high volumes, Data is stored using 'economic'
principles that allow data to be mined but with much lower
urgency.
LEA Actions:
• Active analysis using broad profile testing mechanism.
Action- Filter data to assess if a combination of events
have occurred.
• LEAs provided with Alarm/Report if a profile match
occurs.
• Profile is managed /tuned by LEAs

An Integrated LI/DR Solution

Summary:
• An integrated LI/DR solution is achievable and provides
multiple benefits.
• LI and DR analysis together has the potential to provide
a powerful analysis capability.
• Need an effective end-to-end data capture and store
capability.
• A System that balances storage between LEA and CSP
can optimize costs and maintain operational flexibility
• Need Flexible Architecture.
• Establish a Good, Flexible Mining capability.
• Use Profiling
• Effective, flexible Analysis tools.
