Safety Instructions
The unit HP 3260S is a Jammer. Jammers are transmitters which transmit millions of frequencies at
the same time to block any type of receiver.
A Jammer is a high frequency transmitter. Therefore there are typical terms of use which have
to be known during transmission. A safety distance to the antennas is necessary.
Safety Instruction
Electromagnetic waves can be dangerous for your health. For example we can give no statement regarding the effects on pacemakers at the moment. Therefore we suggest that people with pacemakers
do not use any kind of transmission units or any kind of transmitters, as well as Jammers, were not
used direct to people with a pacemaker.
During transmission
All doors and windows have to be closed.
Outside the vehicle a safety distance from the antennas has to be taken.
The use and operation of the Jammer is only allowed to trained people
and end users.

The first step for operation is to activate the keyswitch at the remote control to put
the Jammer into stand-by mode. Now the single channels can be activated by the
corresponding switches. The remote control will also show the channel status
(ON/OFF).

2. Proposal on ECM Jammer Systems against Terrorist’s bomb attacks during Convoy Operations
Electronic Counter Measures (ECM) or Jamming Systems which are designed to
provide protection for VIPDignitaries against attacks by radio control. Improvised
Explosive Devices (RCIED’s) is a delicate and complicated task. Nobody knows
when, where, on which frequency, what distance between bomb and terrorist &
what distance between VIPCar and bomb during the attack.
ONLY THE TERRORIST KNOWS AND HAS A COMPLETE CONTROL ABOUT THE
WHOLE SCENARIO.
Therefore the VIP protection must be on a very high sophisticated level.
Elaman the manufacturing company of such protection systems with experience
all over the World - Europe, Near East, Middle East, Far East, Africa and America –
since more than 20 years in business – has developed the HP ECM Series to the
clients specifications and needs. Due to this long experience and the back-up with
the user and clients we can give the following proposal:
1. IT must be a SYNTHESIZED SWEEP JAMMER no barrage or white noise
which was already used in World War 2 and is an old technique.
2. NEVER USE FOR CONVOY OPERATION BARRAGE OR WHITE NOISE.
3. The lowest frequency should be around 20 MHz or 25 MHz.
4. The highest frequency should work now around 2000 MHz or higher 2,5 GHz
and if required also up to 3 GHz.
5. Between both frequencies there should be no gaps. Nobody knows whichfrequency the terrorist is using.
6. For the own communication there are other tactical solutions which should only be discussed personally.
7. The unit should be MODULAR each channel is working on its own.
NO breakdown of the whole system if one channel is out of us the others
are still in full operation.
Easy for repair, easy for maintenance, easy for upgrading in new technology or
higher frequencies.
So no black box with no function if something is wrong always modules.

8. Different output power for the different channels. During all our tests and experience with our clients we would suggest:
VHF
20 – 80 MHz
about 125 to 150 W
VHF
80 – 200 MHz
about 125 W
UHF
200 – 500 MHz
about 100 W
SHF
500 – 1000 MHz
about 40 W
SHF2 1000 – 2000 MHz
about 25 W
SHF3 2000 – 3000 MHz
about 15 W
The Channel HF and VHF have no gain with the used antennas all the other
channels have a gain up to + 11 dBi. With these output powers the safety
range is more than 250 meters in all directions which is more than sufficient to protect the VIPs.
9. Never install the Jammer HP 3260S into the VIP car – always escort cars for
more flexibility and safety.
10. 10. Use 2 HP 3260 S – one in front and one in the back of the VIP car or convoy – for the double protection range.
11. The HP 3260 S is installed in all kinds of Off-Road Cars. Range Rover, Land
Rover, MB V, G, M, Toyota Landcruiser, GMC Suburban, Nissan Patrol, Embassador, Ford Explorer etc.
12. The HP 3260 S is easy to operate. If installed once the operator can see and
control each channel on its own, he has full information about power supply
and RF transmission – everything is shown on the remote control and on the
unit itself by LEDs and other optical means.
13. We suggest a maintenance contract with our company to check the HP ECM
Series every two years.
14. Elaman will give complete support for training, advice of spare parts and
measure instruments.
We, Elaman, are proud to mention that all Jammers once supplied to our customers and installed into the various cars are in full operation although some of them
are in use for more than 12 years.

Double Digital Sweep Technology:
We use three special IC’s, which generate the sweep signals. These signals are
being tuned digitally to each single frequency range.
Type of Modulation
We add to the carrier of the sweep signals a FM modulation. We jam with our
DDS all AM/ FM/ SSB signals either analog or digital.

Difference between Technologies
White Noise is generated via a Diode or a Transistor which due to its nature can
not be fine tuned (see attached diagram). This possibility is provided by the sweep
signal.
In addition we like to stress that White Noise signals loose a lot of their initial capacity/output, as most of the input power get lost into heat. Double Digital Sweep
in comparison maintains a constant Level of the output Signal.

4. ABC Charger
User Manual
• Read this instruction before the charger is taken into use.
• Keep this manual within easy reach for the user of this battery charger.
• Hydrogen gas will be produced when charging lead-acid-batteries and hydrogen
gas is explosive.
• Open flames and sparks should be kept away from batteries they may produce
Explosions.
• The charger should be switched off before the charger/battery plug is disconnected.
• It is related with real danger to touch any parts inside the charger. Do not do any
repair work with the main switch ON and to be real sure disconnect the mains
connector.
General
The ABC Charger is suitable both for Freely Ventilated-(Wet) and Valve Regulated(Dry) lead/acid batteries. The charger is small and very light (1,5 kg) an can therefore easily be fitted close to the battery. (The charger can be delivered with program compensating for the equipment base load.) The charger operates in high
frequency and should be connected to a standard 230 V mains connection with
ground. The built in micro controller controls the charging process according to the
chosen charging algorithm. During charging the charging progress is displayed with
a status indicator LED on the front panel. The microcontroller is also controlling the
charging progress with regards to Temperature in the charger an time. If a fault
occurs in some cells or the temperature rises the charging current will be limited.
If you have a special requirement of charging algorithm or application, please contact LEAB.

Installation
The ABC Charger is mainly suited for indoor use. It can be used positioned horizontally on a table or a shelf, hang on a o-wall using the free supplied bracket or as
a built-in charger in the vehicle or machinery. When it is built in it has to be shock
absorbed. The charger can be with fixed connection to the battery or with conventional connectors.
Position the charger in such a way that the air supply will not be obstructed. When
the charger is fitted on a wall or mounted in a vehicle it should be horizontal to limit
dust and moisture to enter it.
Function
Check that battery type and size correspond to the setting of the charger. Also
check that the polarity between the charger and the battery is right. Positive + to
positive + and negative – to negative –. Connect the battery to the charger and
switch on the charger. The charging starts after a few seconds and the status indicator, Orange LED, is lit up. Orange LED remains on until the battery is fully
charged. If the charger is connected to a fully charged battery the charger will be
charging for 1 hour. This is the minimum charging time.
Green LED, is lit up when the battery is ready to be used.
Maintenance charging will continue as long as the battery is connected.
ABC600/800: The charger will be reset as soon as the charger is switched off and
then on.
1600W version is reset by the red knob on the front or by disconnecting the mains
cable.
The charging time depends on the size of battery and the depth of discharge.
A freely ventilated battery (Wet) can be discharged to max. 800 and a valve regulated (Dry) with max. 70%.
OBS: Switch off the charger before the battery is disconnected. If the battery is
disconnected without switching off the charger, sparks may be produces.

6. Servicing Manual for Jammer System HP 3260 S
Measures instruments:

Spectrum Analyzer
Wattmeter

Test procedure:
Connect the channel from 20-80 MHz with an attenuator. Then connect it with a
Spectrum Analyzer, e.g. from Hewlett Packard.
Put the Spectrum Analyzer on start at 15 MHz and on stop at 100 MHz.
Connect the HP 3260 S with a cable to a battery or a kind of generator. Switch the
“key switch” on the remote control ON. Then switch on the single channel from
20 to 80 MHz. Use the button on the remote control.
To check the frequency of each channel, repeat this procedure with every single
channel and on the Spectrum Analyzer.

It is very important that all other channels are still OFF for this test. Every
channel that is working without connecting to an antenna or a coaxial resistor will damage the Jammer. The relevant channel will be broken.
To check the output power in watts use a special wattmeter like for example the
BIRD Wattmeter model 4410A.

9. Batteries

Jammer Battery
AGM
Absorbed Glass Mat (AGM) batteries
Developed for aircraft, AGM batteries
surround the lead plates with layers of
glass mat, which is little more than damp
with electrolyte.The result is that the batteries are particularly tough since the
plates are well supported and there’s no
electrolyte sloshing around. They are relatively new to the UK and European market, but are now the most popular battery
type used in the American marine and recreational vehicle market.
The battery is completely sealed and waterproof, and should continue to work
even under the most extreme conditions. The battery has a very low self-rate of
discharge providing exceptional life during periods of non-activity.
