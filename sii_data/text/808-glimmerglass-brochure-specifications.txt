to partition ports for individual user access
• Bidirectional operation

Intelligent Optical signal Management
The Glimmergiass Intelligent Optical system 500 revolutionizes optical signal
management by enabling network operators to rapidly and remotely access, distribute
and monitor optical signals and create and reconfigure optical paths in real time.
Advanced management software combined with purely optical, photonic crossconnects provide remote operators with superior visibility and control of optical signals.
Intelligent Optical systems provide transparent signal access and are key enablers
of the Ghrnmerglass СуЬеЗwеерT. Their unique capabilities enable the dynamic
selection and distribution of optical signals for analysis and storage.
Glimmergiass optical systems enable operators to;
• Access and monitor optical signals in real time without disrupting traffic
• Remotely create and reconfigure optical signal paths in milliseconds
• Handle any data rate, any protocol and any format including DWDM
• select, duplicate, and distribute optical signals to one or many locations
• Continuously monitor signals and remotely test and diagnose optical paths

Create
Glimmerglass systems provide a fully non-blocking, transparent cross-connect, In
milliseconds an optical path can be created between any fiber input and output. since
the technology is fully transparent, the newly created optical path will transport any
signal regardless of data format or speed.

Monitor
Continuous optical power monitoring combined with transparent switching forms a
superior solution for remotely monitoring network paths and performing diagnostics.
toopbackpaths may be created in milliseconds to help isolate a fault to a particular
piece of equipment.

Reconfigure
Glimmerglass systems are the ideal solution for remotely adding reconfiguring, and
disconnecting optical paths on demand and making system level topology changes.
