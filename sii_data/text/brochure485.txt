core, the Infrastructuresolution creates a fluid,
self-forming, self-healing network that adjusts
even in rapidly changing, mobile situations. A fully
flexible and integrated grid, it can be teamed with
Cobham's variety of surveillance solutions and third
party products to provide access to tactical detail
and evidence. Cobham's Safe Cities solutions can
also build on existing infrastructure without the
need to create a new network.
Cobham is a Milestone partner and is able to
provide the software as part of its Safe Cities
Surveillance Infrastructuresolutions, enabling
