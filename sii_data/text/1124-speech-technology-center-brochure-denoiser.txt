DENOISER CLEAR VOICE
TI eXpressDSP compliant algorithm
Features
Denoiser Clear Voice automatically removes noise
and keeps the useful signal clear and undistorted. It
effectively filters out the noise generated by air
conditioners, street traffic, wind, the power supply
hum, engine rumbling, channel interference,
atmospheric noise and many other types of
background noise. Denoiser Clear Voice
dramatically increases speech quality and clarity
into applications to which it has been added.

Denoiser is fully TI eXpressDSP compliant
algorithm, this guarantees time and money
saving in building in any DSP solution.
This algorithm follows the run-time conventions
imposed by TI's implementation of the C prog
language.
This algorithm is re-entrant within a preemptive
environment (including time-sliced preemption).
All algorithm data references are fully
relocatable.
All algorithm code is fully relocatable.
This algorithm does not directly access any
peripheral device.
This algorithm does not include definitions
specific to a debug variant.
