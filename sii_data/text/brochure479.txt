The Omega Recording Transmitter operates as the normal
Omega Micro Transmitter. I n addition, it features the
possibility of recordingvideo and audio t o the SDHC card
inserted into the device. It allows continuous recordings
despite of any radio path drops.
From the remote control radio channel, the user can
enable Idisable the transmitter and the recorder
separately, if recording, transmitting, or both are required.
I n addition, the user has full remote control of the
recorder.The saved recordings can be viewed, played,
stepped, or deleted remotely from a receiving end, or
new recordings can be made. All remote control features
are available through the Repeater or by the PC software.
The device is compatible with SDHC cards from 4 to 32
GB capacity with FAT32 file system only. It provides up
to 35 hours of recordings in case of fast moving pictures,
or up to 96 hours in case of static objects in front of the
camera. The user can access the RecordingTransmitter
through the Controller, which has to be connected to the
Receiver.
The Receiver must be equipped with the firmware version
8.0 or higher. Older receivers can be upgraded by user.

A real time clock is built into the RecordingTransmitter, so each
recordingcan be dated by a time stamp.
Maximum file length of 30 minutes is ensured by the automatic
splitting function while recordingin order to avoid of very big
files.
Cycle recording is available - when selected, the oldest files
on the card are automatically overwritten by new ones, if the
SDHC card exceeds its maximum capacity.
The VLC Media Player is supported as best choice for later
playing of the card files by a PC. The Windows Media Player
can also be used, but the supported audio codec must be
downloaded in advance.
Special VOX modes are available to trigger recordings.Although
the device does not offer recordings based on image motion
detection, recordings can be triggered by acoustic noise. The
acoustic noise is captured by the microphone connected to the
device and consequently starts the recording. Another option is
a door contact or PIR sensor fed to the audio input instead of a
microphone. These trigger options extends the battery lifetime
as the device consumes only 1 mA during waiting idle state in
its most economical mode.
