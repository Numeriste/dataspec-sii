The Digital RF Portable Briefcase Jammer incorporates
the latest jamming technology in a compact integrated
system. Able to be equipped with a wide range of
frequency jamming modules the Briefcase Jammer can
be deployed in just minutes to protect EOD teams during

modules, antennas, battery, power supply and optional
remote control.
Jamming modules can be selected to provide high power
targeted jamming or wide band with modules available
in bands from 20-6000MHz.

The RF power of the Briefcase jammer can be limited for
safety reasons however higher powers are available with
adjustable output power.
In its basic form one jammer may be set to jam 20-SOOMHz
or 500-1000 MHz or Satellite Phones, CDMA, PCS, GSM,
UMTS, 3G, WiiFi and WiMax bands.
Each frequency band offers the option of blanket jamming
or targeted. The Briefcase is supplied with both Directional
