KEY FEATURES
The HINTON 5000 lnterceptor range IS used by telecommun~cat~ons
operators and law
enforcement agencles to prov~deregulatory compl~ancefor lawful Interception, and by
government agencles ~nvolvedIn the collect~onof s~gnals~ntell~gence
for homeland secur~ty
purposes. The data gathered IS used to counter terrorism, corruption and cr~m~nal
threats
such as drug traff~ck~ng.

I KEY BENEFITS

I
Th~slatest generation probe has been developed to prov~dea h ~ g hdens~ty,fully featured,
monitoring capab~lityuslng SDH/SONET (STM-1/OC-3) optlcal Interfaces. E l / T l interfaces
may be mon~toredby rnult~plex~ng
them together to create one (or more) STM-1/OC-3
rnterfaces. Bu~lt-lnautomated slgnaling discovery, CIC mapping and visualization tools allow
agencies to quickly correlate signaling and bearer channels, simplifying field deployment.
A powerful probe, ~tallows the real-t~metargeting, detect~onand capture of data on all

channels all of the t~me.It can handoff 100010 of the data to law enforcement agencles
or f~lterthe data by target ~nformat~on
to any level as requ~red.
Telesoft Technologies has been deploying intelligence gathering and lawful interception
solutions since 1991. Our family of HINTON products allows government and law enforcement
agencies to select one vendor for all their intercept needs. We have built an enviable reputation
for ease of connection, field reliability and our ability to provide innovative solutions.

HINTON 5000 Interceptor
International and PSTN Probe

International gateways and fixed PSTN

networks are passively monitored to record
voice and fax/modem traffic
All key signaling types supported: SS7 lSUr
ISDN PRI, R2 MFC, C5 CAS, MAP, and CAMEL

I

The HINTON 5000 Interceptor Internationaland PSTN Probe is capable of targeted or mass
capture of a few conversations on a handful of STM-1/OC-3 links to entire countrywide
wirel~netelecommunications networks, capturing subscriber voice communication and
network information, and providing data handover using standards-based interfaces from
ETSI/ITU and national standards bodies.

Bearer channel content targeting:
DTMF and fax/rnodem

I

International and PTSN Probe

This high-performance probe monltors the optical links on international gateways, or links in
national PSTN telecoms networks. Automated survey tools within the HINTON 5000 Interceptor
configure the probe to extract signaling and bearer data and handoff all data from mass
intercept or target-specif~cindividuals or groups of subscribers as needed via complex filtering.
