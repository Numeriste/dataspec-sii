PKI Development

PKI Electronic Intelligence GmbH has been engaged in the development and production of
surveillance systems for more than 40 years. Our main project at the moment is the
development of wireless energy transmission, especially for our monitoring devices. This
will allow unlimited operation of a monitoring system without integrated power source.
Furthermore it is possible to activate the device from outside.
Nowadays the systems use stray magnetic fields by which the received power is reduced
depending on distance which has a drastic impact on their efficiency. The magnetic coupled
systems mainly work at the antinodal point, in order to increase the range and transmitted
power. We expect to be able to launch a fail-safe product in 1-2 years. PKI has also
improved their proven laser monitoring systems. Automatically working digital filters
suppress noise levels resulting in interference-free receipt of voice signals.
PKI Electronic Intelligence GmbH worked hard on difficult in- and outdoor monitoring
systems. This product range comprises various versions of stethoscopes as well as
completely wireless audio/video surveillance devices of 20 mm Ø for fixation on windows.
Even higher windows can be reached by our newly developed CO2 launcher.
Furthermore we would like to point out our mobile Audio/Video CCD-LED night vision
camera with video glasses and earphone. This device allows completely unobtrusive
monitoring at a distance of up to 100 m under no-light conditions.
The recording technology of Audio/Video signals has been revolutionized by micro memory
cards. PKI offers all imaginable constructions, some of them not bigger than a fingertip,
camouflaged in watches, sunglasses or pens.
Our GSM/GPS developments are interesting as well. These allow mobile audio/video
surveillance from all over the world, indicating the exact location and this in a housing not
bigger than a matchbox.

PKI Products in the Seventies and Today
PKI has been producing equipment for protection of a country against internal and external threats since 1968. Of course the technology
has experienced tremendous changes in the course of more than 40 years. Hereunder we will give you some brief explanations.

Transmitting and receiving monitoring devices
These so-called “bugs” are still used nowadays. However analogue technology
has been replaced by digital technology. This new digital technology offers completely
different possibilities such as GPS and GSM.

The receiving units have also made great strides.
Even here the digital devices dominate the market.
Especially the enlarged frequency ranges and increased
input sensitivity have to be pointed out.

Electronic Stethoscope
These devices have always proved to be indispensable.
Outdoor surveillance is still very popular.

Recording devices
Secret voice recording is still of utmost importance.
The devices have been revolutionized by digital technology.

Production and Development

Detecting devices
Various constructions have been developed
in order to detect so-called “tapping bugs”.
Most of them are designed as hand-held
and/or portable devices.

Phone monitoring
Phone monitoring is still the easiest and most
effective method to obtain important information.
GSM-systems now allow this from all over the world.

Jammer
Formerly these devices were limited to the UHF-range.
By means of today’s modern digital technology much
higher interception frequencies can be achieved which
increases the need for efficient jammers in order to make
eavesdropping devices and remote controls useless.

Visual monitoring
Taking secret photos still remains one of
the main sectors in surveillance activities.
Even here the digital technology
has changed everything.

Night vision
Where IR-night vision devices were used in
former times, nowadays we use low-light
amplifiers or thermal cameras.

Of course we could show you so many more examples, however, we think that professional monitoring comprises an ever larger range.
PKI offers you “all from one source”. We are looking forward to a fruitful relationship.

Interception and Monitoring Systems

PKI 1500

Cellular Monitoring System
PKI is worldwide one of the leading producers of
monitoring devices of cellular phones.
This highly sensitive field of interception is of
utmost importance to all government agencies,
especially secret-service departments, as
state-relevant information is globally frequently
exchanged via cellular telephones. To control
such tasks it is indispensable to use the PKI
devices.
PKI 1500 is a multi-channel cellular monitoring
system designed for passive interception of GSM
radio signals. It intercepts GSM network
information data directly without interfering with
the GSM network. It is completely passive and it
will never be detected by the target person. The
system includes eight duplex channels, control
and data processing analysis software, UHF
antennas and laptop. It has the advantage of
compact design, friendly interface and is easy to
operate. It can easily be put into a vehicle or
anywhere you want for your action. The system
provides voice monitoring and very accurate
tracking and locating function of target mobile
phone.
PKI 1500 is the most advanced and unique GSM
locating subsystem, without using any 3rd party
GPS device and with the only built-in fabulous
full angle antenna. The GSM locating sub-system
is built-in and can be separated from the whole
system. The system is equipped with a
decryption module which is capable of handling
A 5.0 and decrypting A 5.2 encryption protocols
in real-time.
Basis functions
The system provides eight duplex channels using
the following frequency ranges of 900 MHz, 1900
MHz or 900/1800 MHz. According to some
feature of the signal, the system can
automatically select the best channel to monitor
and record. The system supports simultaneously
operation on multiple networks and is suitable
during mobile operation. While operating in an
area where many cellular phones exist PKI 1500
offers two working modes: in random
interception mode it can monitor and record up
to 8 full duplex calls and SMS including the
relevant duplex phone identities such as TMSI,
IMI, IMEI, BCD number, target distance from the
base station etc.. In special mode the system can
monitor and record incoming and outgoing calls
and SMS of special target phones and at the
same time the system can extract all relevant
phone identities of target phones.
Localisation
PKI 1500 works in real time and with a locating
accuracy of approx. 2 meters. It uses vehicle and
personal locating subsystems in order to locate
the target phone. The position of the inactive
target phone will be rapidly (10-15 minutes)
located without becoming aware by the phone
user. Should the operator know the location area
and cell IDs of the target phone in advance the
locating time will be even much shorter.

10

Monitoring
PKI 1500 provides three modes, i.e. target phone
monitoring, blind interception and short
message monitoring in the unencrypted GSM
network. When target phone monitoring is
required the system monitors all details
concerning the target phone call, i.e. it provides
the phone number of both parties, voice, cell
parameters, when calling started and ended,
distance from the base station etc. In case of
blind interception the system collects call
information in a local region. By using its
8-duplex-channels
PKI
1500
records
conversations, calling and called numbers
simultaneously. The provided information can be
listened to in real time or as playback later. The
third mode is the short message monitoring
mode which allows not only blind interception of
short messages in local regions but also
direction finding and locating of the target phone
sending short messages.
Soft Ware
PKI delivers a special developed software with C
language. We provide a pre-installed laptop and
media installation for backup. All intercepted
communications (voice, SMS and the relevant
identity datas) are stored on a hard disk which
can be easily accessed by the operator. The
software has a strong ability to query target
records and to relisten.
Installation
The host equipment will be placed in the vehicle
whereas the antenna can be camouflaged in any
roof box.

PKI 1800

Digital Telephone Monitoring System
The PKI 1800 is a comprehensive and state-ofthe-art end-to-end solution for monitoring,
processing, analysis and dissemination of
intercepted telecommunication interactions.
Due to rapid structural changes in worldwide
telecommunication systems a solution
integrating all such tasks is provided by the PKI
1800. It offers facilities to monitor ISDN, Digital,
PCM30 transmissions as well as all other forms
of communication whether they be voice, fax,
modem, radio communication or other data
transfer. Based on a single, unified platform, PKI
1800 handles all kinds of telephone and Internet
data and thus offering unprecedented features. It
provides security agencies with flexibility,
reliability and versatility in signal intelligence
interception and analysis. The PKI 1800
combines all these facilities to comfortably
managing unlimited amounts of intercepted
communications together with instant target
information by just using a minimal amount of
space and manpower. The major feature of the
PKI 1800 is its flexibility and extraordinary
storage capacity, linked to its ability to instantly
recall, via the displayed data management target
software, intercepted target telephone calls
without interrupting the digital tape recording
and archiving process. This enables the operator
to either carry out interception and playback from
one system, or optionally via a separate playback
unit. This means that highly classified and
priority interception can be configured for
transfer by authorised users on a real time basis
to a selected location ensuring that the right
persons are informed on time.
The PKI 1800 is available in several versions,
depending on the number of channels and
end-users monitoring requirements, from
minimum 8 channels to 64 or max 128 channels.
The major criteria of the PKI 1800 software is to
display all information immediately and to enable
instant evaluation, thus dramatically reducing the
time needed, compared to time-consuming
evaluation of reel or audio tapes. The software is
known as the target evaluation and configuration
interface (TEC) which is installed onto the
delivered workstation. The sophisticated menu
provides optimal guidance for selection/viewing
and processing of large quantities of data. The
TEC software has one control menu and 4
submenus being linked to user's authorisation
key code. They are easiliy accessible and can be
seen at a glance on the display monitor. Upon
entry to the main control menu selection, the
user will see - displayed on the screen - the
current channel status which provides activity
information as well as remaining tape time, disk
end time and selection for the 4 submenus via
the preprogrammed password. The configuration
menu enables the user to select and change the
technical charateristics of each channel
depending on the input conditions. This enables
the PKI 1800 to monitor telephone interception
from various types of exchanges and radio
communication input channels simultaneously.

• Non detectable input impedance
• Simultaneous playback and
on-line recording
• Network upgradeable, high MTBF
reliability, 1/T1 interception

essential accessory to the PKI 1800. Housed in a
standard desk top PC with built-in 4 channel
voice card, hard disk and loudspeaker the digital
playback unit is used for a number of
applications. Usually used as a playback unit for
evaluation of recorded data it alternatively can be
used as a mass storage facility for archiving or as
a supervising position. It incorporates the
standard PKI 1800 software enabling instant
recall and evaluation. The intercepted data is
loaded onto the digital playback unit from the
DAT cassette or linked to the PKI 1800 for
automatic download. The unit can be installed
with one or two DAT drives, enabling the
evaluated data to be downloaded onto the 2nd

automatically onto standard audio cassettes. Due to the integrated voice
control the recording does not start until beginning of a conversation and
automatically stops at its end. The total recording time is up to 8 hours. With
the PKI 1870 you have the possibility to control all telephone conversations
in your house during your absence. A similar device for digital telephone
systems is part of our product range as well. Please contact us for detailed
information.
Specifications:
• Recording time: 8 h on standard 120 min. audio cassette
• Integrated microphone for notes

PKI 2205

Analogue Room Transmitter
Room monitoring requires a small but powerful
audio transmitter. Latest technology and
consequently low current consumption allows up
to 15 hrs continuous surveillance operation. Only
by implementation of SMT (surface mount
technology) its extremley small dimensions
could be achieved. Metal housing manufactured
by rotary-grinding from one metal block provides
excellent emission characteristics. The placing of
a bug has to happen very quickly. The PKI 2205
room transmitter with its external power supply
solves the problem, because only the external
battery has to be connected and the unit is ready
to operate. The PKI 2205 Room Transmitter is
available in standard frequencies within UHF
band. VHF, SHF or spezial frequencies
are available on request.

PKI 2210

Analogue Telephone Transmitter
If a telephone monitoring operation is on long
term basis or access to the target area is
restricted then the PKI 2210 Telephone
Transmitter is the perfect solution. It is not
necessary to have direct access to the telephone
set. Any location along the telephone line can be
used for monitoring. This transmitter operates
automatically, i.e. the internal off-hook detection
circuit automatically switches from standby to
activation and transmission. Only transmitting
when a telephone conversation takes place, this
wireless bug is undetectable. The sensitivity on
the telephone line can be adjusted manually.
Another advantage is its independence from
short-lived power supplies like batteries, so that
a continuous monitoring of the target area is
guaranteed. The installation on the telephone line
should be made in serial mode. Both polarities
are allowed. PKI 2210 is available in standard

PKI 2265

Room Transmitter (PCB)
Wherever monitoring transmitters have to be
used in disguised operations, this micro
transmitter is the perfect choice, as it has been
especially designed for camouflaged operations.
Therefore, and to reduce the size to its minimum,
just the printed circuit board (PCB) is supplied.
For each and every government department’s
operation, this tiny little transmitter should be
used for discrete observation of rooms. Because
of its small size and unobtrusive pattern, it is a
perfect tool to monitor rooms from inside a
hidden place. A film-size plastic cover protects
the components against environmental
influences. Powered by battery and equipped
with a highly sensitive microphone, this
transmitter can be placed into any object of daily
use and picks up the sound from up to ten
meters. The crystal controlled transmittance

guarantees a totally stable frequency which only
can be received by our special receivers like PKI
2220. Depending on surrounding conditions, a
transmitting range of 800 to 1000 meters may be
achieved.

Interception and Monitoring Systems

PKI 2275

Mains Transmitter (PCB)
Monitoring of rooms essentially needs to have
camouflaged transmitters, but in most cases no
new items can be placed into the room in
question. Therefore already existing devices have
to be used and equipped with an unobtrusive
transmitter. For this purpose, the PKI 2275 is the
right solution. Due to the very small size of this
printed circuit board (PCB) mains powered
transmitter, it does not need much space and
very easily can be concealed in sockets, lamps,
junction-boxes etc. Additionally the protective
cover with a special lacquer shields from
occasionally unwanted contacts and short-cuts.
Depending on existing power supply, the PKI
2275 can be supplied either in 110 to 115 VAC/60
Hz or 220 to 240 VAC/50 Hz versions. The
integrated microphone of highest sensitivity
allows to capture sounds from a distance of up to
10 meters. With its output power of 4 mW a

transmitting range of up to 800-1000 meters
may be achieved (depending on surrounding
conditions).
Specifications:
• Small size
• Easy to hide within existing objects like mains
sockets, power distribution or lamps,
radios etc.

only be operated by batteries and should be
activated only when persons are in the room.
Therefore and in order to save battery capacity,
the PKI 2290 has been developed according to
the latest technology standards as it is
automatically activated by reception of
noises/sounds. Whenever there is no sound, the
built in automatic voice control (Acoustomatic)
will switch the transmitter into a stand-by
position.

PKI 2345

Digital Recording Set
This system solves each problem in terms of
long-time observation and is the most secure
monitoring device available at this time. A great
advantage of this system is that monitoring of
telephone lines and observation of a room can be
done without having an operator at site all the
time. Monitoring and transmission is only made
if necessary, i.e. that operation is only effected
whenever it is secured that no other person can
listen to the transmitting frequency. PKI 2345
operates totally noiseless. Additional accessories
for telephone observation, whether digital or
analogue, as well as an external microphone for
room monitoring can be connected. The digital
recorder stores all telephone and room
conversations. By means of the supplied remote
control the stored information is transferred to
the receiver by just pressing one button. From
the integrated receiver all such information can
be heard or stored on a separate medium.

switching-on, the PKI 2670 works fully
automatic and does not need any further data
input or control. The operation status is indicated
by 4 LED’s. The position data is given every 60
seconds, either by pressing the “INFO” button or
by activation of the integrated movement
detector. This informs the operator of the
location of the person, incl. name of town and
street name. This information can also be shown
on digital maps. The full data of the last 120 days
can also be recalled. Furthermore, the supplied
communicator allows direct calls from the

PKI 2715

Computer Interception System
„Tempest“ is the common term for every kind of
radiation emitted by computers. Each device and
part - such as printed circuit boards, monitors
and connecting cables - emit a specific radio
signal (compromising radiation) which may
contain the fullscreen content of the actual
operation of the computer in question. Such
signals can be received and reconstructed with
our PKI 2715. This provides a fast and easy
monitoring of a PC in order to see what work
actually is done on this. By means of a
directional antenna and the special receiver, the
incoming data are synchronised and analysed.
The received signal then can be seen on the
provided display. Depending on type of computer
to be monitored the max. distance may vary from
approx. 10 to 50 meters. The complete system is
supplied by us to government departments

exclusively in order to guarantee full prevention
from unauthorised persons committed with
industrial espionage, terrorism or any other
criminal act.

PKI 2775

Scrambled GSM Phone
Most people think that mobile phone calls cannot
be eavesdropped or tapped because the system
already uses encryption. Unfortunately this is not
the case! Actually in most countries the signals
are encrypted between the mobile phone and the
base station but this data stream can be
decrypted with a normal PC. It is even easier to
tap GSM phones with a device that simulates a
base station which inserts itself between the
mobile phone and the provider network. In
Germany such easy-doing eavesdropping causes
damages of approx. 10 billion Euro per year just
in the field of industrial espionage. PKI 2775
offers the right choice in order to be prevented
from this! Each PKI 2775 works with an
individually generated and certified key pair.
These are stored on the net card which is
inserted into the phone. If another PKI 2775
(which has its own individual key pair) is called,
using the crypto function, the partners are
authenticated by means of the two key pairs and
the two chip cards. A “one-off” session key (one
out of 1038 possible keys) is generated and this
is used only for this single communication. This
session key encrypts all signals transmitted
between the two phones. Whoever intercepts this
encrypted data stream will only hear a noise
which cannot be decrypted even with the highest
performance mainframe computers. PKI 2775
operates efficiently in all standard 900/1800 MHz
GSM networks in all countries.
In addition to the integrated encryption system
PKI 2775 has all the features of a normal, Up-todate business mobile phone. It still can be used
for unencrypted calls to any other phone. For all
encrypted and secure communications as well as
for all unprotected calls your standard SIM card
is used - therefore you do not have to change
your phone number in order to use all PKI 2775
features.

PKI 2910

Professional Voice Changer
In many cases of disguised observations it is
indispensable to have telephone conversation
with the person in question. Under such
circumstances the observer should not be
identified by his voice. Especially in cases of
taking hostages with following black-mails, the
PKI 2910 is the best possible tool for not
identifying the caller’s voice. In real-time, i.e.
without any delay, the voice will be changed from
male to female or even children and vice versa. It
can be used from any mobile telephone, PKI
2910 offers a wide spectrum of frequency
changes, is highly portable and can be used with
any type of telephone or even mobile phones.
Transmission is effected by the supplied
acoustic-coupler. Just connect this acousticcoupler to the microphone of your telephone and
use the microphone of the PKI 2910. The
integrated pitch, Mi-balance and formant
adjusters are creating the change of voice
frequencies.

Specifications:
• Dimensions:
approx. 180 x 120 x 30 mm
• Weight: approx. 280 g
• Power supply:
9 VDC block battery
• Effective adjustment:
3 sliding switches
• A) pitch control – for increase or
decrease of audio frequency
• B) formant control – regulates the

PKI 2925

Directional Microphone
Whenever it is necessary to listen to a
conversation at outside areas and from a certain
distance, the PKI 2925 is the best possible
choice. This unit is constructed as a directional
microphone in the form of a tube. Such types
more easily can substitute parabolic mirrors, as
their shape is less obtrusive compared to
parabolic mirrors. That eases the way of
camouflaging during operation. Even from inside
a car, with opened windows, or from hidden places in open terrain, the PKI 2925 can be used.
But in order to come as close as possible to the
physical advantages of such parabolic mirrors,
the PKI 2925, in buyer’s option, can be supplied
in two different lengths of tubes with the same
efficiency. For a best possible handling, an
ergonomical-shaped handle is supplied, which
can be detached if required. The complete set,

incl. headset and accessories comes in a
ruggedized, splash-proof hardcover case.

This exceptionally small-sized directional
microphone captures acoustic signals from up to
100 m distance, which are amplified up to max.
10.000 times by its integrated low-noise
high-power amplifier. Due to the built-in
high- and low-pass filters you can listen to
conversations at a distance of 50 m, as they
allow especially voice frequencies to pass
through and eliminate undesirable noises. It is
incredible, that this is possible, particularly in
this inconspicuous cigarette box. Even audio
transmission is done in an excellent quality. The

PKI 2950

Microphone Cable Reel
The PKI 2950 especially was developed for wired
room monitoring applications. Due To its
cable-based operation this unit is not detectable
by any counter measure equipment. The
subminiature electret microphone with its small
dimensions and the small diameter of the
shielded cable is ideally suitable to be hidden
behind wallpapers, curtains or in window frames.
The small dimensions of the microphone prevent
from detection by measuring equipment based
on analysing the non-linear junction effect
generated in semiconductors. The complete
system consists of the highly sensitive electret
microphone with shielded connection cable, a
cable reel with output socket, headphones and
the separate audio amplifier. The supplied audio
amplifier provides a low-noise amplification
adjusted to the subminiature electret microphone
of this system together with a 5 band graphic
equaliser and every necessary output for direct
listening or recording of conversations. Features
like direct listening with headphones, a socket for
recording devices and the possibility to extend
the total cable length by driving different reels in
cascade, fulfill all requirements for effective
surveillance.

PKI 2960

Optical Microphone
The PKI 2960 ultra-sensitive optical microphone
captures a wide range of sounds from normal
conversation to soft whispering or even the
shuffling of papers with excellent sound
accuracy. Being designed for governmental use
in SWAT, Special Task Forces and tactical
operations it offers surveillance operations and
applications requiring RFI/EMI immunity. A beam
of light is sent through an optical fiber to a sound
sensitive membrane. Sound signals cause the
membrane to vibrate and modulate the intensity
of the light reflected by the membrane, which is
then translated into an electrical signal. PKI 2960
delivers a high signal to noise ratio, so even very
low-level sound inputs can be heard clearly and
accurately from many meters away. With an
omni-directional polar pattern, the PKI 2960 can
capture sounds from all directions, thus
maximising voice representation. The excellent
frequency response provides true-tosound
reproduction. The PKI 2960 cannot be detected
by electromagnetic methods since the
microphone head neither contains metal parts
nor generates electromagnetic fields and is
separated from its electronic components by
several meters of optical fiber. With its miniature
dimensions and versatile configurations it can be
installed in a variety of ways to elude discovery
both by the naked eye and sophisticated
detection equipment such as non-linear junction
detectors. Because of its RFI and EMI immunity

the PKI 2960 can continue to operate even in the
harshest environments without any effect to its
performance.

Outdoor Investigation Shooting Stethoscope-Kit
For more than 40 years PKI is engaged in AV
observation out- and indoor. Consequently our
product range offers numerous devices for this
application. Please see our below listed devices:
PKI 2215 - PKI 5715.
Often the rooms which shall be monitored have
only access from outside, so that due to security
reasons this is the only possible surveillance
method. PKI 3000 therefore offers a very special
version as now upper floors can be monitored.
On activation the transmitter is shot by a
launcher, that is equipped with a CO2-cartridge,
up to a distance of 25 m at full speed. If the
transmitter reaches a window or masonry it will
stick there and wirelessly transmit the acoustic
waves captured from behind the wall up to 50 m.

PKI 3100

Laser Monitoring System
This PKI 3100 Laser Monitoring System has
been designed for secret surveillance operation if
access to the target room is totally impossible.
The laser transmitter sends an invisible infra-red
beam to the window of the room to be
monitored. A certain part of the laser beam is
reflected by the windowpane which vibrates
slightly due to sound waves caused by the
spoken words inside. Due to the law of optics,
the beam is reflected in the same angle, i.e. the
angle of incidence is equal to the angle of
reflection. In order to capture the reflected beam
in the middle of the lens the receiver must be
positioned very accurately. The captured beam
can now be converted into electrical signals,
which - after filtering - are amplified and fed into
headphones and/or recording devices.

PKI 4400

Portable Noise Generator
The PKI 4400 is designed as an easily portable
acoustic noise-generating unit, which can be
carried in coat-pockets or briefcases, in order to
protect sensitive conversations inside rooms.
The PKI 4400 Portable Noise Generator is very
versatile, as it can be fixed on many different
surfaces inside the room in order to protect
sensitive conversations from being monitored.
The typical application is found in conference
rooms with critical areas like windows and non
controllable adjacent rooms. It is suitable for
walls, floors, ceilings, water- and/or heating
pipes and windows. By means of the supplied 4
resonators, the unit creates a noise which, by its
vibrations, disturbs every common microphone
by overlapping the sound-waves of spoken
words. The optimised voiceband noise masking
reduces the effectiveness of eavesdropping
devices such as contact microphones, wired
microphones inside walls, battery operated audio
transmitters or devices using mains power

supplies for operation as well as laser-/
microwave- and/or infrared reflections from
windows. Any environmental masking easily is
possible by using several units of the PKI 4400 at
the same location. The PKI 4400 can be mounted
to any smooth surface by the use of the provided
suction cups or just placed in any critical area.

PKI 4650

PKI 4655

Wired Noise Generator, Wireless Noise Generator
The technology of monitoring devices is rapidly
increasing and detection and location of such
devices is very hard to realize. Transmission
frequencies of such items may vary nowadays
from VHF- to upper GHzranges. Additionally
optical monitoring systems, like Lasers, Infrared
Systems and Audio-Stethoscopes are in use.
Therefore it is essential that government
departments, as well as industrial companies
protect themselves against such monitoring
devices. For this purpose we have developed our
PKI 4650 and PKI 4655. With both systems an
electronic generator creates a white and/or pink
noise which is emitted via the resonators to the
windows, doors or walls. The resonators can be
placed and fixed by the supplied special mastics
material. By means of these vibrations, such
monitoring devices are interfered and an
understandable transmission is impossible. PKI
4650, as the standard set, comes with the
generator and four cable-connected resonators.
PKI 4655 uses the same principle but is
independent from cable connections, as the
resonators are battery-operated and each unit
consists of an integrated generator and
resonator. Each unit can be placed within
seconds. Depending on room size, the number of
devices can vary from one unit only to infinity.
This white-noise generator especially is in use
where members of conferences should not be
aware of such protective actions.

object you wish to locate, not only the indicated
field strength but also the tone pitch increases.
Sound alarm of course can be switched off in
cases where sounds must be avoided, as for
example during sweeping of a room where active
transmitters might be in operation. The
sensitivity of reception is especially high within
the frequency range of mobile phones and
wireless video transmitters, i.e. between 0,9 and
5,8 GHz.

always is essential in cases where an
unobstrusive alignment to this is necessary in
order to choose one of the specific listening
devices like our Laser Monitoring Device PKI
3100 or our Infrared Observation System PKI
3200. Any special task forces, may it be from
police or military departments, should have the
PKI 5110 as an essential tool for their purposes.
This hand held and low-weight unit perfectly
matches to these requirements and is as easy to
handle like an ordinary binocular. By looking
through the device you can obtain the right direction (in case of the use of one of a.m. devices or
directional antennas for wireless monitoring
and/or any other listening devices) and by
pushing a button, automatically and within a
second the right distance to the object will be
digitally displayed. The binocular is equipped

with transmitter- receiver and allows measurements up to 10 km distance. The unit exactly
measures the distance and angle and the results
are shown on the integrated LCD indicator. The
reported measurements will help to choose the
right objective for optical observation systems
and the right angle for directional microphones
or antennas.

The PKI 5410 emits a powerful and directional
beam of IR-light being invisible to the human
eye. IR-light sources can only be used in
combination with night vision devices (see our
products in this catalogue) and therefore this
unit, with its integrated brightness control, is the
ideal solution for observation tasks under bad
light conditions, in the total darkness with fully
clouded sky or at problematic locations. This
torch lamp has been developed according to the
latest technical standard. It is lightweight and
easy to handle. A 5 mW IR-Laser-Diode inside
the PKI 5410 provides the necessary power for
ranges of up to 100 m. With the adjustable optic

at day and night. The system can be switched
from permanent to sensor operation, i.e. the
built-in motion sensor will be activated by
captured actions or movements, which
automatically starts the whole system.
Cascading is also possible, provided for example
every 100 m one of our multifunctional camera is
installed. In case of a convoy with VIPs driving
down a certain road, all actions will be
automatically monitored and recorded.
Transmission of audio video signal is effected
with high resolution and frame rate.
Diversity-antenna-principle is used for reception,
which means that the antennas are slightly
displaced allowing multiple reception of the
antenna signals.
The various antenna signals will be evaluated and
only the best parts will be combined to a
high-quality, error-free signal. This offers a
considerable advantage compared to standard
receivers in respect of range and transmission

Frequency Ranges for Audio / Video Transmission
Frequency range 2.4145 – 2.4705 GHz
This frequency range is approved all over Europe. It is used for industrial and commercial operations. Transmitting power of 10 mW can be divided into 5
channels. 3 channels can be used for parallel operations. Standard video signals will be transmitted in PAL, NTSC or SECAM data format. When using a
sensitive receiver within sight a range of approx. 300 m can be obtained and even 600 m with an external 8 dB antenna.
Frequency range 2.3670 – 2.3740 GHz
This frequency range is developed for industrial, commercial and scientific applications in mobile agricultural broadcast and for police for example.
Transmission power of 10 W (HF) and 25 W (EIRP) is possible, divided into 16 channels. Standard video signals of PAL, NTSC or SECAM data format can
be transmitted approx. 9 km within sight and even 21 km with external 8 DB antenna.
Frequency range 5.732 – 5.867 GHz
This audio / video transmission range is especially suitable for industrial and commercial operations and for special tasks. The transmission power of 25 mW
can be divided into 16 channels of which 6 channels can be used for parallel operation. Video signals of PAL, NTSC or SECAM data format can be transmitted. These frequencies are approved all over Europe. Range will be approx. 150 m at sight, and approx. 300 m when using an external 8 dB antenna.
Frequency range 0.868033 GHz – 0.868560 GHz
These frequencies are designed for analogue and digital switching signals with a transmitting power of 25 mW. 8 channels are available of which channel 1
and channel 8 can operate parallelly. The frequencies comply with European regulations. Range is approx. 3 km at sight. We can deliver special systems in
the 0.869 GHz range with up to 10 W and 32 channels.
Frequency range 0.4332 – 0.4346 GHz
This range can be used for unidirectional transmission of analogue switching and audio signals. The transmission power of 10 mW can be divided into 8
channels. Channel 1 and 8 can operate parallelly. The frequencies are approved all over Europe. The range is approx. 4 km at sight.
Frequency range 24.040 – 24.230 GHz
These frequencies are for point-to-point transmission. Data format PAL, NTSC or SECAM will transmit standard video signals. Transmission power is up to
100 W and can be divided into 16 channels. The used antennas are directional antennas with high gain. Its range is 5 km at sight using 36 dB antenna.

Antenna techniques
Omnidirectional and directional antennas have on their horizontal plane an almost circular directional diagram. Therefore radiation is crosswise to axle. In
general this means that a higher antenna gain induces a plainer emission angle and consequently a larger emission range. On the other hand, directional
antennas show on horizontal and also on vertical plane a strong directed emission. Due to this fact they are less susceptible to interferences from other
directions. Generally you can say that the higher the gain, the planer is the emission angle and the longer the range.

The diversity function
If possible the user wants to obtain a high-quality, failure-free signal especially if he has challenging applications in urban or mountainous areas. In order to
achieve this aim PKI provides on request video receivers with several slightly staggered antennas which allows multiple reception of the signals. The system
evaluates the various signals and the best parts will be combined to one single high-quality and failure-free signal. This method represents a great
advantage compared to normal receivers concerning range and transmission quality. A progression of this antenna function is the SMRC-diversity unit.
The digital system combines ideally the benefits of a maximum ratio combining and a selection combining technology. It mainly consists of a diversity
receiver and an antenna system with 8 independent antennas. The obtained results will exceed all expectations and provide an outstanding level of
transmission quality, coverage and range which common video transmission systems never achieve.

Audio Video Digital Transmission
COFDM stands for Coded Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing! It is a supplement to OFDM digital modulation scheme providing integrated digital
false correction, selectable guard interval, resistance against multipath fading and burst failures. COFDM is perfectly suitable for mobile reception of digital
signals.
The modulation plays an important role for the transmission. “QPSK” is designed for sound, faultless transmission, “16 QAM” is sufficient for normal
picture quality, whereas “64 QAM” can be selected for highest picture quality as it works with highest data transmission rate.

Digital Way of Compression GOP (Group of Picture)
This way of compression (MPEG-compression) reduces video pictures of a video stream differently. The so-called I-frame (Intra-frame) will be compressed
independently from the other pictures and is in general the largest data file of the video sequence. The I-frame serves as basic information for the following
pictures (B-frames = bidirectional frames) and defines their reference within the video stream. They are considerably smaller because only their
discrepancies to other pictures are stored, as they cyclically appear as GOP (Group of Pictures). They are followed by the P-frame (predicted frame) that
contains reference information for the I-frame, which is the basic data for this kind of compression. One GOP expands from one I-frame to the next. GOP’s
often have a length of half a second. The following types of pictures can be included: I-Picture resp. I-frame, reference pictures (equivalent to freeze image
and independent of others). Every GOP starts with this type of frame.

Digital Data Transmission
What is meant by Guard Interval?
The time period which is available for a reflection is indicated as the guard interval. A guard interval of _ allows longer reflections but also means a lower
rate of data transmission. When using a guard interval of 1/32 only shorter reflections will be compensated resulting in a higher rate of data transmission.
What is meant by code rate?
The code rate indicates how many of signal parts will be used for error correction. Code rate _ means that half of the signals will be used for error
correction whereas code rate 7/8 only needs 1/8 of the signals. Consequently, the effective data rate is higher in code rate 7/8 as much more signals will be
used for transmission.
What is meant by band width?
The band width indicates the quantity of signal transmitted. This means, the higher the band width the more data can be transmitted. When using more
systems parallelly a lower band width has to be selected in order to avoid interferences and to increase stability and quality of the transmission.

PKI 5715

Window Camera
The PKI 5715 has been designed as a miniature,
colour camera with a wireless transmitter and
optional receiver. It is really the best choice for
visual room observation from outside, if a
permanent presence of the observer is not
possible but still he must be informed of what
happens in a closed room. Due to its very small
dimensions and low weight, the PKI 5715 is
hardly perceptible. When fixed at the edge of the
window pane (with our supplied special adhesive
material), this wireless miniature colour camera
provides a direct view into a room even under
low light conditions (min. 1 Lux) for the
observation of all activities inside the room.
Because of the built-in video transmitter such
surveillance can be effected from a distance of
several hundred meters (depending on

PKI 5720

conditions, whether in dark rooms or outside at
low daylight or even at night, the PKI 5735 is the
right choice for every government related
agency. With its minimum illumination
sensitivity of only 0,0003 Lux, and the extremely
high resolution of 600 horizontal TV-lines, this

which helps to identify a person, a car number
plate or even a small suspicious parcel, which
may be a postal bomb laid down in front of a
sensitive area. For all such purposes a camera
has to be suitable in size and weight. With its
very small size of approx. 20 x 20 x 18 mm and
the minimal objective opening of only 1,4 mm
the PKI 5735 is ideal for disguised mounting at
any place. It either can be powered by 12 VDC

PKI 5785

Wireless Audio/Video Transmitter Ball
There are of course different possibilities to gain
access to the object to be observed. However, in
some cases there might be a high wall or
security personnel or even other circumstances
which prevent you from entering certain
premises in order to install corresponding
surveillance devices. In this case we recommend
the PKI 5785, because this Hi-tech ball is a
relatively simple equipment. The lower half of the
transmitter ball is 4 times heavier than the upper
half. Because of the gravity the heavy lower half
always remains on the ground. The upper half is
provided with 3 video cameras with pinhole
lenses at an angle of 110°. This guarantees that
always a picture is transmitted from the desired
direction. This of course also applies for the
built-in directional microphones. The built-in
audio/video transmitter with 4 channels transfer
the signals to the LCD monitor delivered with the

PKI 5785 within a frequency range of approx. 5,8
Ghz. up to a distance of approx. 200m and
continuously up to 3 hours. Optionally we can
also offer an additional remote control in order to
activate the transmitter ball only if required and
such enabling observations for several weeks.

PKI 5790

Miniature Video Repeater
Small-sized video cameras with integrated
transmitters only have a limited transmission
range. Wherever larger distances to receiving
points have to be covered, it is necessary to use
a repeater-station. Our PKI 5790 is the right
solution for such applications. It receives the
standard video signal within the 1.2 GHz range
and transfers this into the 2.4 GHz range. With its
max. output power of 4 Watts and the 18 dbi
directional Yagi-antenna, a max. distance of up to
20 km (depending on surrounding conditions) is
possible. PKI 5790 especially has been
developed for disguised purposes, and its
smallest dimensions are perfect for any mobile
operation. Power supply of the PKI 5790 is
provided by a separate 12 V rechargeable battery
and/or mains adapter/charger. For the reception
of the signals we recommend our PKI 5755 A/VReceiver/Recorder.

Video and Night Vision Systems

PKI 5800

AV Night Vision Set
This high-tech A/V system developed by PKI
exceeds everything that might be available on the
market so far. The reasons for this are very
simple:
1) no low light amplifier (poor video resolution
and expensive)
2) no laser (dangerous for the eyes)
3) weight (portable device too heavy)

camera connected to an IR-hybrid illuminator for
night vision. This handheld device with
integrated directional microphone allows
observation at day and night up to 200 m
distance at the highest possible resolution.

Jamming Systems

PKI MOBILE JAMMING SYSTEMS VEHICLE MOUNTED
Modular Design
The PKI modular jamming system can be scaled and adapted to any necessary application. Depending on available space
and power, country of destination and customer specification PKI adapts the electronics and antennas to match given
specifications.
Full Range Jamming
Frequencies can be covered from 20MHz up to 6000MHz using high sophisticated sweep generators which are capable
of interfering analogue and digital transmissions. Depending on the requested power the number of incorporated units
may vary.
Intensified Bands
Based on our experience on available remote controls of cell phones and other devices we incorporate additional units to
improve the covered distance for well known frequency ranges.
Sweeping Technology
PKI „High Speed Sweeper“ show how precise the power amplifier are modulated. This avoids unnecessary technical side
effects which could endanger the mission.
Power Supply
The high power modules of the HF-modules can be either powered by:
•Vehicle engine alternator
•Independent Generator
•Mains operation
For high power systems vehicle engine alternator, also improved versions (< 2 KW), might not be sufficient to source a
system. Therefore we offer a build-in high power generator solution.
Cooling
Depending on the given environment of the country of operation, we offer separate cooling solutions for the electronics
and driver compartment.
Antennas
All antennas are specially designed to the specific frequencies to broadcast.
We offer two options for the antennas:
•directional antennas, because they are much more effective to produce a „clean“ corridor along the convoy
•omni-directional antennas
Shielding
All high power jamming systems are equipped with special protection mechanism to avoid health damages to the driver
and the operators. Even though the output power is in the official limits, we protect the car with special window foil to

normally installed in the boot of a car with
antennas mounted on top of the rear wings or on
the roof. Its total output power is 400 W rms. The
unit is controlled via a wired remote control box
which contains the master on/off switch, band
selection and low battery warning LED. Reverse
polarity protection is fitted as standard. The unit
requires a 24 V power supply. An optional
analogue FM Spread Spectrum radio link is

PKI 6600

Jammer for Mains Circuits
Most of the time a room monitoring attack is
carried out by more or less smart RF bugs, in
some cases even equipped with remote control
to prevent quick and easy detection by counter
surveillance scanners. But less sophisticated and
low cost solutions like Intercom systems for the
communication through the main lines most
often are not taken into consideration. Such
systems simply can be bought in normal stores,
and by removing the housings, the basic
components are small enough to be hidden in
places of mains power distribution sockets or
junctions. Therefore the risk of this kind of attack
is enormous. The PKI 6600 as a jammer system
for mains protects sensitive areas against room
eavesdropping through the mains line. PKI 6600
simply has to be plugged into the mains socket
and is running fully automatic and disturbs the
signal with an AM/FM-modulated noise. Direct
listening to the target transmission is possible
via headphone.

PKI 6660

Car Lock Jammer
This jammer is designed for the use in situations
where it is necessary to inspect a parked car.
Whenever a car is parked and the driver uses the
car key in order to lock the doors by remote
control, normally he does not check afterwards if
the doors are really locked or not. For such a
case you can use the PKI 6660. It can be placed
in car-parks, both outdoors and in car-park
buildings. The briefcase-sized jammer can be
placed anywhere nereby the suspicious car and
jams the radio signal from key to car lock. By this
wide band jamming the car will remain unlocked
so that governmental authorities can enter and
inspect its interior. The complete system is
integrated in a standard briefcase. Optionally it
can be supplied with a socket for an external
antenna, so that PKI 6660 can even be placed
inside a car, parked in the same area, with the
antenna placed on top of the car. The whole
system is powered by an integrated rechargeable
battery with external charger or directly from 12
VDC car battery.
Specifications:
• Dimensions: standard briefcase approx. 50 x 40 x 20 cm
• Weight: approx. 5 kg

• Jamming of a particular
frequency or channel
• Modular system based on 19" racks
• Hopping of jumping frequencies
• Sweeping of a frequency band at
ultra-high speed

• Output antenna: integrated inside the briefcase,
optionally external antenna if jammer is
positioned inside a car

PKI 6670

Remote Control Duplicator
Often the door of an observed car has to be
opened without leaving any damages or traces.
This is quite difficult sometimes! Our remote
control duplicator enables you to open any car
door easily. When a driver opens his car with a
remote control, an encrypted signal will be sent
to the car which opens the door. This signal will
be captured by our duplicator and decrypted.
With the obtained data a new remote control will
be programmed with which it’s very easy to open
the door of the relevant car without leaving any
trace.

PKI 7650

Bionic Sensor
The PKI 7650 is a portable and selfcontained
mini laboratory being developed in co-operation
with renowned German institutes for
silicon-technology and eBiochip systems. On the
spot it provides a fully automatic recognition of
selected biological agents within less than 30
minutes. The flexible technology of the PKI 7650
is based on silicon-chips, on which antibody
substances respectively DNA-structures are
placed. This allows the identification of all kinds
of important biological agents in next
procedures. As all these biological agents are
hard to identify, and their influence to human
bodies only takes place after a certain period, it is
most essential to have a fast and reliable
identification of such substances for an effective
and reliable prevention. Just with this single and
innovative concept of sensors, the whole range
of dangerous biological agents can be
determined. By means of different chipsticks,
even in accordance with customer’s
requirements, the range of detectable materials
can be enlarged . For such amendments,
alterations at the base-unit are not necessary. For

122

each integration of further enlargements, like
automatic feeding of up to ten chipsticks and/or
upcoming PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction),
various adaptable modules are available. The PKI
7650 is in use with many NBC and fire-fighting
departments worldwide and with its dual
measuring positions for negative and positive
results, it offers a fast and reliable method to
determine selected biological agents. Using the
PKI 7650 in urban traffic systems, like

underground-, bus- and railroad stations it will
give an immediate indication about pollution with
dangerous biological agents. This enables the
special forces to act before the first unspecified
symptoms at human beings are recognised
(most often only after 24 to 48 hours).
Furthermore the PKI 7650 can also be attached
to our PKI 7550 Modular EOD/IEDD Robot for
extended security to the first responding team in
cases of emergency.

PKI 8255

Gas Warning Instruments
The PKI 8255 family comes in three versions for
the detection of either CO, H2S and O2. All
instruments are equipped with a well arranged
display providing the most important
information. During the development the main
focus was laid on a long operating time without
need to exchange sensors or battery. Just two
buttons allow handling of the unit. Each
instrument can be configured via an infrared
interface. PKI 8255 allows adjustment of several
display modes, different alarm limits, measuring
units (mg/m3) or a life signal. As a special
accessory a helmet holder is available allowing
fixation of the device not only at the chest pocket
or belt, but also at the helmet. The sensors,
installed in the instruments, guarantee a lowest
drift, cross-sensitivity and longest service life for
operation during a two-years period without
calibration. After a 2-year operating period (1
year in case of 0² detection) the user may need to
renew the instrument or to receive a

PKI 9100

Disguised Metal Detector
Either for participants at specific meetings or
during general check-up tasks at entrances,
where people have to be examined, without their
knowledge, the PKI 9100 Disguised Metal
Detector is an especially designed equipment for
detection of both metallic and non-metallic
objects. Because of its hand-free application the
operator - at one and the same time - can
examine a person physically and investigate,
automatically and electronically, for the presence
of metallic objects. Its silent vibrating alarm
allows fully covert operation and is able to
discriminate between large and small metal
objects. The PKI 9100 comes in one universal
size, which fits both the left and right forearm,
fixed by a velcrostrip, and can be hidden under
every normal clothing like shirt or jacket. It is

simple to use as the user just approaches his
arm inconspicuously towards the suspect
person. If this person carries a weapon or any
other metallic object, the vibrator will give its
silent alarm.
Specifications:
• Weight approx. 200 g
• Operating time approx. 80 hours with standard
9 V battery
• Ideal for body searches
• Combines physical and electronic
investigations
• Silent vibrating alarm
• Standard 9 V battery
• Fully automatic
• 100 % finger dexterity

PKI 9105

Hydraulic Jamb Spreader
In several cases, doors have to be opened by
force in a silent and quick manner because
criminal acts like drug dealing, hostages or
terrorism have to be intercepted and rooms have
to be entered to arrest the expected perpetrators.
The PKI 9105 is designed for Police and Military
Special Assault Teams and other government
departments especially trained for such tasks.
This device is using a quiet hydraulic pressure
technique to spread door jambs and release latch
bolts. The non-slip clutch allows the telescopic
bar to hand-fit into the door opening. The
operator then uses the hand pump, which
quickly extends the piston and exerts 3 tons of
force - enough power to open or break most
types of single doors. The system virtually works
noiseless, is fast and instantly adjustable.

Specifications:
• Max. Power: 3 tons
• Weight: approx. 7.7 kg
• Carrying bag black:
CORDURA with dual
handles plus shoulder strap
• Size of carrying bag:
approx. 66 x 116 cm
• Colour: tactical black finish

PKI 9110

Series of Door Rams
In combination with our PKI 9105 Hydraulic
Jamb Spreader, the PKI 9110 as a series of door
rams with different sizes and weights offers a
perfect combination with our full range of tools
to open doors by force. Every police-, military-,
anti-drug and special operational task force team
should be equipped with this product as it is the
one and only device that is capable to give
immediate entrance into rooms where scenes of
crime are suspected. It really could not be easier
to use and no setting up time is required.
Originally the PKI 9110 have been developed for
US Police Swat teams, but now are more and
more used by police and Military Special Forces
worldwide. Simply get in position in front of the
door, swing the ram back to gain momentum and
swing it forward to smash the toughest door.
Three different versions are available each one being electrically non-conductive,
shock-absorbent, compact and this at a very
reasonable price.

140

Specifications:
Different versions are available but each
department should have the full range of rams in
order to be prepared for every different
application. Therefore we offer the complete
range as a set consisting of:
PKI 9110/A - This ram is designed for one-man
operation with a length of 76 cm and a weight of
16 kg. It only requires 50 to 60 cm of backswing,
making it ideal for use in close quarters.
PKI 9110/B - This ram is a heavier version, 25 cm
longer and 7 kg heavier than the above ram and

can be used by either one or two persons
simultaneously.
PKI 9110/C - This ram is the smallest and most
cost-effective door-ram yet designed. It is ideal
for very confined spaces. It is made of specially
modified steel shot and is only 41 cm in length,
but has the same weight (16 kg) as the
PKI 9110/A, and provides the same kinetic
energy.
We recommend the complete set of
PKI 9110/A-C, however, each ram of course can
be ordered separately as well.

PKI 9115

Underwater Metal Detector
The PKI 9115 is a versatile under water detection
system being consequently the further
development of our former land & underwater
metal
detectors.
Improved
detection
performance and a wide auto-adaptation to
interfering metal components characterise the
new PKI 9115. The full unit, and especially the
electronic design, is based on our thousandfold
proven technology being in service with many
government departments worldwide. PKI 9115 is
tested for water pressure up to 10 bars and is
very comfortable to handle for the diver. It is
operated by only one adjuster. PKI 9115 can
detect minimum amount of mine shallows being
buried - such as A/P 72 A - at operational depth.
Larger undefined objects can be located up to a
depth of 1.5 m. For even larger depths, a further
sensor is available.
PKI 9115 applies a dynamic mode pulse
induction concept. Short bipolar magnetic pulses
generate detection signals from ferrous or
non-ferrous metals and alloys. Target acquisition
is indicated as visual or audible alarm. A silent
mode (visual LED only) improves operator’s
safety on “smart” munitions with acoustic
sensors. When used with a larger search head of
80 x 80 cm (optionally available), the detection
range is significantly extended and larger objects
- such as 105 mm shells, bombs, torpedoes etc.
- may be detected at 2 m depth or more. The
detector operates on a dynamic search mode,
which compensates interference from metal
diving equipment. If required, the detector can be
operated in a “silent mode” without headset.
In such case the red LED will indicate target

acquisition. To operate the PKI 9115 switch the
rotary sensitivity calibrator into position I (low),
II or III (high). Sensitivity can be changed
stepless within ranges I-III by an internal adjuster
inside the electronics cylinder.
Optional accessories - available on request:
• probe 32 x 370 mm
• oval search head 300 x 170 mm

PKI 9120

Mine Detector
The PKI 9120 mine detector is designed for use
on all grounds even on compact soils such as
volcanic soil or laterit, which makes it suitable for
use everywhere in the world. In many regions
mine detectors can be influenced by a mixture of
soils such as laterit, magnetic rock and by soil
conductivity due to monsoon rain. The wide band
compensation of this PKI mine detector meets
such environmental working conditions and also
rejects interference from saltwater due to its
pulse induction operating principle. Components
subject to wear and tear can easily be exchanged
without further calibration work. This eases fault
definition and significantly improves equipment
availability in the field.
Rugged design and constructional features,
coupled with various accessories make the PKI
mine detector a very versatile equipment, which
allows use in lying, kneeling or upright position.

System consists in its selectivity regarding small
metal objects buried close to the surface and - in
comparison to active metal detectors - its
excellent detection range on large objects
(transmitter effect). For conventional operations,
there is a galvanometer and an audio alarm
integrated into the electronic box. Furthermore
the system has an analogue data output and can
therefore also be linked to an external data logger
to allow data recording.

goods (drugs, explosives, weapons, currency,
etc.) and the object in which the contraband is
hidden. For example, an “empty” tire filled with
air and a tire filled with drugs give different
results or an “empty” cross member in a freight
container stuffed with contraband indicates a

different density then a full one. It also detects
radioactive materials. The PKI Contraband
Detector directs a beam of energy into the
inspected object. A filled space reflects back
more energy than an empty space. As PKI

Contraband Detector is moved across the
surface of the object, the measurement is
displayed on a digital LCD and an alarm is given
if the density changes or radioactive material is
encountered.

PKI 9410

Image Processing System
The PKI 9410 is a full colour video processor for
the simultaneous display of live and stored
images (still pictures). It is designed for police
stations, border controls, immigration and
customs offices and any other place where
banknotes and documents have to be checked
against falsifications. For all these types of
document examinations, the PKI 9410 offers a
tremendous wide range of different functions
such as overlay, addition, subtraction and side by
side view for easy comparison of genuine and
suspect documents. The main features of the PKI
9410 are:
• Comparison by superimposition
• Box image inside large image
(PIP=Picture in Picture)
• Horizontal split screen
• Vertical split screen
• Forgery detection by superimposition
The PKI 9410 selects one of two analogue video
inputs and converts it to a digital format. Every
further processing thereafter is carried out in the
digital realm but still preserving a highest video

quality. The digital image can be frozen in the full
resolution frame store and the output combined
in various ways with the live image. After that the
combined image finally is converted back to an
analogue format for display on monitor. From the
front panel the operator can adjust the quality of
the incoming video and the way in which the two
images have to be combined. Cursors are used to
adjust the selected parameter or to move the

picture. The reset/home button returns the
parameter to the standard setting.

PKI 9525

Door Opening Kit for Cars and Rooms
Professional observation often requires the
installation of surveillance devices in locked
rooms or cars. In order to solve this problem we
have developed an universal kit for opening
doors of rooms and cars. The PKI 9525 should
be the basic equiment of every government
organisation being involved in the fight against
terrorism and criminal acts. It contains the
standard pick sets, hooks for opening the doors
of cars and a gun plug for grinding barrel locks.
If required we can of course also offer the
complete range of our door opening devices plus
our training seminars at our premises. We wish
to point out that the user of our door opening kit
must have some experience and talent in order to
be successful in this field.

PKI 9530

Car ID Set
Very often the original chassis numbers of stolen
cars, machines etc. are made invisible, grinded
away or even replaced by new, forged numbers.
With our PKI 9530 the originally stamped
numbers can be made visible again. This
identification set especially has been assembled
for the use by special police forces and other
government departments being related to the
identification of stolen cars or other valuable
items. Basically, a testing can only be executed
on iron materials and if the ID-numbers have
been impacted automatically or by hand. A
magnetic flux is produced in the soft-iron-core
by two magnetic coils. This magnetic flux is
directed into the material via the poles. If the
lines of magnetic flux impact vertically hit on a
material-compression, some of the lines drop
out of the material and from the magnetic stray
field at the compression field point. Now the

magnetic powder has to be applied on the
compression point and the magnetic stray field
will attract all available iron parts of the powder
in order to react against the magnetic
air-resistance.
Specifications:
• Content:
1 pce hand yoke magnet for evidence of grinded
ID-numbers
1 pce UV lamp for visualisation of numbers

PKI 9585

Door Opening Kit for Cars
In many cases of surveillance it is of utmost
importance to open a monitored car without any
risk of damage in order to install for example
microphones, cameras or GPS-systems. For this
application there are different systems available
which we have combined in one set:
1.) Decoder for car lock cylinders
2.) Lock picks for car lock cylinders
3.) Car lock scanner
4.) Car Killing Kit
These special tools can also be delivered
separately. In most cases it is important to find
out the model and year of manufacture of the car,
for example by using our decoder for car lock
cylinders. With this code you are now able to
directly compose a special key for the car by
using the provided master keys. For this, you do
not need any further tools or machines.
Everything is contained in the set. Our software
can decode even the latest generations of car
lock cylinders and then offer a proposal for the
key code. Concerning the lock picks it is also

essential to know the model and year of
manufacture of the car. Please indicate this
together with your order. The tools of the car lock
scanner are used to crack the code of the plates
integrated in the tumbler of the car lock cylinders
even of the latest generation. By means of the

cracked code it is now possible to cut a matching
key. The car killing kit consists of different bent
needles made out of steel wire which are inserted
through the rubber joint in order to reach the
locking mechanism of the car.

PKI 9590

Electric Powered Multipick Door Opening Kit
This door opening kit works with up to 44.000
vibrations per minute. Even locks with more than
20 tumblers on several locking sections can be
opened within seconds. The frequency of the
strokes can be adjusted continuously. The power
supply is guaranteed by means of a built-in
battery. Most of the opening kits of our
competitors destroy the door lock which is of
course acceptable in case of an emergency.
However, such tools cannot be used for
surveillance operations. PKI 9590 can be used in
order to open and relock all current available key
cylinders without damaging them at all. This is
imperative for all kind of room surveillance. The
PKI 9590 works in such a way that a special pick
is inserted into the locking canal of the key
cylinder. The pick is then put into extremely high
vibrations which are transferred at the correct

angle to the locking bolts of the key cylinder. The
locking bolts put into such a vibration fall into
their corresponding locking positions and such
enabling the core of the key cylinder to rotate
freely as if it was opened by using a matching
key.

because of any special material, we recommend
our thermal lance. It penetrates any material like
cast iron, steel, stainless steel, concrete, granite,
nickel, ceramic or titanium compound as well as
aluminium. The fuel rods reach a temperature of
up to 5.500°C at the tip and therefore can cut,
melt or liquefy the different materials indicated
above. Each lance burns about 30-40 seconds.

created the easy-to-use PKI 9600 set which is
indispensable in order to prove the car theft, as it
makes the originally stamped chassis number
visible again. You simply have to apply the
adequate etching gel on the place where you
suspect the chassis number, to treat it with the
included brush and afterward with the
neutralising liquid. In order to protect your hands
always put on the included gloves. After this
treatment the chassis number will clearly
reappear.

There is a magnetic (PKI 9530) and a chemical
(PKI 9600) procedure as the surface of the
material with chassis numbers may vary from
one car type to the other. So it could be very
useful to test both methods.
Specifications:
• Dimensions of the aluminium case:
32 x 25 x 10 cm
• Weight: 1 kg
• Contents: 3 bottles with etching gel for
aluminium, steel and copper
2 bottles with neutralising liquid
1 brush, 1 magnifier with UV-light

Electric Shock Baton
The PKI 9700 Electric Shock Baton is the most
versatile instrument to protect police officers,
anti-terrorist squads and security guards from
personal attacks at demonstrations, riots and
other dangerous situations. Even private security
companies should be equipped with this device
for their own personal protection during their

into a beltsling like provided with our PKI 9255
Immediate Response Jacket or can be fixed to
the hand by the attached sling and then being
right at hand at any time. The PKI 9700, coated
by hard rubber material, provides an electric
shock to the aggressor whenever touched but
also can be used as a common baton.
Additionally the PKI 9700 produces a cracking
noise and high voltage sparks whenever the
electric shock function is activated by the
integrated switch. This already will stop any
further attack but even if the aggressive person
steps forward, a single touch, of some seconds
only, to its hip or upper-body region will
immobilise him for a certain time, without
causing any dangerous, long-lasting or even
lethal injuries.

Safety Suitcase
The PKI 9710 has been developed for secure
transportation of various valuable items, such as
cash money, jewels, important documents, etc. It
features multiple functions to avoid theft and
pilferage. Sensors are integrated in the handle
and both surfaces of the suitcase, which can be
activated, so that the PKI 9710 emits
high-voltage pulsed electric shocks of 30 KV. The
wireless activation is done by means of a small
remote control that must be carried separately
from the suitcase. This remote control also
activates the “loss function”, which prevents
from simply forgetting it somewhere during
voyages or theft. If the distance between the
remote control and the PKI 9710 exceeds 3-15
m, a loud warning signal will be emitted. If ever
the suitcase has really been stolen by someone,
for your own protection you should wait until the

PKI 9745

Irritant Gas Defence System
The PKI 9745 has been developed as ancillary
component for already installed alarm systems.
It consists in a defence system with irritant gas,
which is approved as protection against people,
combined with a warning announcement. Its
housing is made in extra solid stainless steel to
protect against damage. Once the main alarm
system is turned on, the PKI 9745 switches into
standby mode. Only an alert will activate the
defence system. At first a loud warning message
will be announced: “Leave the secure area
immediately, or irritant gas will be released”. This
clear and unmistakable warning gives the
intruder the possibility to retreat. Otherwise, if he
ignores it and continues to enter the detection
range of the PKI 9745, the irritant gas will
automatically be ejected. If this discouraged the
intruder and he backs out, the PKI 9745 will turn
back into standby mode. If the intruder however

continues to approach, further irritant gas
ejections will be released. After each ejection the
dose of irritant gas will be increased. By turning
off the alarm system, the PKI 9745 will be turned
off as well.
Specifications:
• Irritant gas, approved as protection against
people in 400 ml cartridges covering areas up
to 300 m². Stainless steel housing with
adjustable wall bracket, control unit protected
against damage, with LED-display and key
switch to protect against unintended activation,
cable length 1.5 m
• Operating temperature: -20° to +45°C
• Dimensions:
diameter approx. 160mm, length 330 mm
• Weight: approx. 6.5 kg

PKI 9750

Defence Tool
These tools are indispensable for all persons
working as security guards, whether at
government departments or in industrial
companies like power plants, metal- or chemical
factories etc. In order to avoid that they are
seriously injured or even die when doing their job
or by being attacked by demonstrators, terrorists
or other crowds ready to use violence, they
must be equipped with adequate defence
devices. However, it is necessary to practise the
application of these special tools. With our
special training courses we can provide each
user with the necessary knowledge to use our
equipment correctly and to avoid injuries.
Unlike the tools of many other suppliers the PKI
9750 includes a wide range of features,
i.e. baton, torch light and tear gas in one tool.
Optionally tools with bent hooks for capturing a
person or tools with a grip and long lance to keep

the aggressor at a safe distance are also
available.

PKI 9780

UV-Set
This UV-set consists in a strong UV-LED light,
UV-ink, UV-pen and UV-spray and offers all
facilities to convict perpetrators. Once applied on
different surfaces and items, the UV-substances
remain invisible for the human eye and can only
be visualized by means of the strong UV-LED
light. This is also the case for texts written with
our UV-ink. To do so, just fill the UV-ink into a
common fountain pen. If a person touches the
UV-marked items, these UV-substances will stick
on his hands, fingers or clothes. Afterwards he
can easily be identified with the UV-LED light. Of
special interest is our UV-spray. Applied onto
bank notes, floor grounds, jewelleries etc. it
adheres to them during several days and
transmits itself to the person that touches them.

Afterwards nothing is easier than to provide
evidence with our strong UV-LED light.
Specifications:
• UV-LED light:

PKI 9800

Perpetrator Convincing Kit
Visible perpetrator materials are special powders
or pastes that are applied on valuable items like
bank-notes, documents, laptops etc. Touching
these marked items will create a long-lasting,
clearly visible and permanently existing dot on
the fingers and hands. Even persistent washing
with water and soap cannot remove these stains
which easily detect the theft. Invisible perpetrator
materials, however, are special powders or
pastes which are only visible under special
UV-lamps (like our PKI 5405) and are invisible to
the naked human eye. With the PKI 9800, we
offer a complete set of every necessary material
for a rapid and effective perception of
perpetrators. Other companies only offer single
components which then have to be assembled to
a workable kit. Our complete case PKI 9800

offers all this in a “all-in-one” assembly of
state-of-the-art materials, guarantying that each
government department is perfectly equipped
with an outstanding assortment of visible and
invisible powders and pastes plus every
necessary tool in order to identify the
perpetrator.
Specifications:
• Coloured powders and pastes, black, red,
green, yellow, silver and copper for the visible
marking

PKI 9885

Surface Penetrating Radar
The PKI 9885 is a revolutionary, highperformance system designed for detecting any
object concealed under the ground or behind
walls. It has been designed according to the
specific requests of several government
authorities worldwide and is now in full operation
with Police, Military, VIP-protection and
commercial companies. The unit is completely
weatherproof and can operate in any type of soil
condition. Depth of detection depends on size of
object and type of soil, but is typically up to 3
meters.
The complete system consists of 3 main parts:
• the controller ( which in fact is a ruggedised
personal computer)
• the antenna set
• the transmitter/receiver head, which transmits
the information from the antenna to the
controller
The PKI 9885 works by sending out pulses of
electromagnetic energy and detecting the
electrical echo caused by dielectric differences
within the surface being investigated. One of the
main features is that during a search, as the
antenna is moved across a surface, the data is
shown in colour and in real time on the monitor.

This means that an anomaly beneath the surface
can be seen immediately whenever the PKI 9885
passes over it, thus making instant and on-site
decisions possible. The data can be downloaded
and printed on a paper-strip or stored on the hard
disc for further processing or inclusion in a
survey report. The standard system is supplied
with a 500 MHz antenna which has a typical
penetration depth of 1.5 to 2.5 meters in good
conditions, i.e. where sand and peat are good
and salt water and clay are poor. The other

antennas in the range are the 250 MHz (typical
penetration depth of 2.5 to 4.5 meters) and the 1
GHz and 2 GHz antennas. As a geneeral guide,
the lower frequency antennas (250 and 500
MHZ) are normally used for work below ground
and the higher frequency for work above the
ground. Important to know is that as soon as the
penetration depth increases, the resolution will
decrease. Hence the 1 GHz and 2 GHz antennas
are very useful for locating very small objects
behind a surface - such as a wall.

PKI 9890

Explosive Isolation Unit
The Explosive Isolation unit is a simple-to-use
and intrinsically safe steel box developed for safe
