Measuring the distance to a possible target
always is essential in cases where an
unobstrusive alignment to this is necessary in
order to choose one of the specific listening
devices like our Laser Monitoring Device PKI
3100 or our Infrared Observation System PKI
3200. Any special task forces, may it be from
police or military departments, should have the
PKI 5110 as an essential tool for their purposes.
This hand held and low-weight unit perfectly
matches to these requirements and is as easy to
handle like an ordinary binocular. By looking
through the device you can obtain the right direction (in case of the use of one of a.m. devices or
directional antennas for wireless monitoring
and/or any other listening devices) and by
pushing a button, automatically and within a
second the right distance to the object will be
digitally displayed. The binocular is equipped

with transmitter- receiver and allows measurements up to 10 km distance. The unit exactly
measures the distance and angle and the results
are shown on the integrated LCD indicator. The
reported measurements will help to choose the
right objective for optical observation systems
and the right angle for directional microphones
or antennas.

IR Torch Lamp
The PKI 5410 emits a powerful and directional
beam of IR-light being invisible to the human
eye. IR-light sources can only be used in
combination with night vision devices (see our
products in this catalogue) and therefore this
unit, with its integrated brightness control, is the
ideal solution for observation tasks under bad
light conditions, in the total darkness with fully
clouded sky or at problematic locations. This
torch lamp has been developed according to the
latest technical standard. It is lightweight and
easy to handle. A 5 mW IR-Laser-Diode inside
the PKI 5410 provides the necessary power for
ranges of up to 100 m. With the adjustable optic
the beam can easily be focussed. The unit is
powered by a rechargeable NC-battery and a lid

at day and night. The system can be switched
from permanent to sensor operation, i.e. the
built-in motion sensor will be activated by
captured actions or movements, which
automatically starts the whole system.
Cascading is also possible, provided for example
every 100 m one of our multifunctional camera is
installed. In case of a convoy with VIPs driving
down a certain road, all actions will be
automatically monitored and recorded.
Transmission of audio video signal is effected
with high resolution and frame rate.
Diversity-antenna-principle is used for reception,
which means that the antennas are slightly
displaced allowing multiple reception of the
antenna signals.
The various antenna signals will be evaluated and
only the best parts will be combined to a
high-quality, error-free signal. This offers a
considerable advantage compared to standard
receivers in respect of range and transmission

Frequency Ranges for Audio / Video Transmission
Frequency range 2.4145 – 2.4705 GHz
This frequency range is approved all over Europe. It is used for industrial and commercial operations. Transmitting power of 10 mW can be divided into 5
channels. 3 channels can be used for parallel operations. Standard video signals will be transmitted in PAL, NTSC or SECAM data format. When using a
sensitive receiver within sight a range of approx. 300 m can be obtained and even 600 m with an external 8 dB antenna.
Frequency range 2.3670 – 2.3740 GHz
This frequency range is developed for industrial, commercial and scientific applications in mobile agricultural broadcast and for police for example.
Transmission power of 10 W (HF) and 25 W (EIRP) is possible, divided into 16 channels. Standard video signals of PAL, NTSC or SECAM data format can
be transmitted approx. 9 km within sight and even 21 km with external 8 DB antenna.
Frequency range 5.732 – 5.867 GHz
This audio / video transmission range is especially suitable for industrial and commercial operations and for special tasks. The transmission power of 25 mW
can be divided into 16 channels of which 6 channels can be used for parallel operation. Video signals of PAL, NTSC or SECAM data format can be transmitted. These frequencies are approved all over Europe. Range will be approx. 150 m at sight, and approx. 300 m when using an external 8 dB antenna.
Frequency range 0.868033 GHz – 0.868560 GHz
These frequencies are designed for analogue and digital switching signals with a transmitting power of 25 mW. 8 channels are available of which channel 1
and channel 8 can operate parallelly. The frequencies comply with European regulations. Range is approx. 3 km at sight. We can deliver special systems in
the 0.869 GHz range with up to 10 W and 32 channels.
Frequency range 0.4332 – 0.4346 GHz
This range can be used for unidirectional transmission of analogue switching and audio signals. The transmission power of 10 mW can be divided into 8
channels. Channel 1 and 8 can operate parallelly. The frequencies are approved all over Europe. The range is approx. 4 km at sight.
Frequency range 24.040 – 24.230 GHz
These frequencies are for point-to-point transmission. Data format PAL, NTSC or SECAM will transmit standard video signals. Transmission power is up to
100 W and can be divided into 16 channels. The used antennas are directional antennas with high gain. Its range is 5 km at sight using 36 dB antenna.

Antenna techniques
Omnidirectional and directional antennas have on their horizontal plane an almost circular directional diagram. Therefore radiation is crosswise to axle. In
general this means that a higher antenna gain induces a plainer emission angle and consequently a larger emission range. On the other hand, directional
antennas show on horizontal and also on vertical plane a strong directed emission. Due to this fact they are less susceptible to interferences from other
directions. Generally you can say that the higher the gain, the planer is the emission angle and the longer the range.

The diversity function
If possible the user wants to obtain a high-quality, failure-free signal especially if he has challenging applications in urban or mountainous areas. In order to
achieve this aim PKI provides on request video receivers with several slightly staggered antennas which allows multiple reception of the signals. The system
evaluates the various signals and the best parts will be combined to one single high-quality and failure-free signal. This method represents a great
advantage compared to normal receivers concerning range and transmission quality. A progression of this antenna function is the SMRC-diversity unit.
The digital system combines ideally the benefits of a maximum ratio combining and a selection combining technology. It mainly consists of a diversity
receiver and an antenna system with 8 independent antennas. The obtained results will exceed all expectations and provide an outstanding level of
transmission quality, coverage and range which common video transmission systems never achieve.

Audio Video Digital Transmission
COFDM stands for Coded Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing! It is a supplement to OFDM digital modulation scheme providing integrated digital
false correction, selectable guard interval, resistance against multipath fading and burst failures. COFDM is perfectly suitable for mobile reception of digital
signals.
The modulation plays an important role for the transmission. “QPSK” is designed for sound, faultless transmission, “16 QAM” is sufficient for normal
picture quality, whereas “64 QAM” can be selected for highest picture quality as it works with highest data transmission rate.

Digital Way of Compression GOP (Group of Picture)
This way of compression (MPEG-compression) reduces video pictures of a video stream differently. The so-called I-frame (Intra-frame) will be compressed
independently from the other pictures and is in general the largest data file of the video sequence. The I-frame serves as basic information for the following
pictures (B-frames = bidirectional frames) and defines their reference within the video stream. They are considerably smaller because only their
discrepancies to other pictures are stored, as they cyclically appear as GOP (Group of Pictures). They are followed by the P-frame (predicted frame) that
contains reference information for the I-frame, which is the basic data for this kind of compression. One GOP expands from one I-frame to the next. GOP’s
often have a length of half a second. The following types of pictures can be included: I-Picture resp. I-frame, reference pictures (equivalent to freeze image
and independent of others). Every GOP starts with this type of frame.

Digital Data Transmission
What is meant by Guard Interval?
The time period which is available for a reflection is indicated as the guard interval. A guard interval of _ allows longer reflections but also means a lower
rate of data transmission. When using a guard interval of 1/32 only shorter reflections will be compensated resulting in a higher rate of data transmission.
What is meant by code rate?
The code rate indicates how many of signal parts will be used for error correction. Code rate _ means that half of the signals will be used for error
correction whereas code rate 7/8 only needs 1/8 of the signals. Consequently, the effective data rate is higher in code rate 7/8 as much more signals will be
used for transmission.
What is meant by band width?
The band width indicates the quantity of signal transmitted. This means, the higher the band width the more data can be transmitted. When using more
systems parallelly a lower band width has to be selected in order to avoid interferences and to increase stability and quality of the transmission.

PKI 5715

Window Camera
The PKI 5715 has been designed as a miniature,
colour camera with a wireless transmitter and
optional receiver. It is really the best choice for
visual room observation from outside, if a
permanent presence of the observer is not
possible but still he must be informed of what
happens in a closed room. Due to its very small
dimensions and low weight, the PKI 5715 is
hardly perceptible. When fixed at the edge of the
window pane (with our supplied special adhesive
material), this wireless miniature colour camera
provides a direct view into a room even under
low light conditions (min. 1 Lux) for the
observation of all activities inside the room.
Because of the built-in video transmitter such
surveillance can be effected from a distance of
several hundred meters (depending on

PKI 5720

conditions, whether in dark rooms or outside at
low daylight or even at night, the PKI 5735 is the
right choice for every government related
agency. With its minimum illumination
sensitivity of only 0,0003 Lux, and the extremely
high resolution of 600 horizontal TV-lines, this

which helps to identify a person, a car number
plate or even a small suspicious parcel, which
may be a postal bomb laid down in front of a
sensitive area. For all such purposes a camera
has to be suitable in size and weight. With its
very small size of approx. 20 x 20 x 18 mm and
the minimal objective opening of only 1,4 mm
the PKI 5735 is ideal for disguised mounting at
any place. It either can be powered by 12 VDC

PKI 5785

Wireless Audio/Video Transmitter Ball
There are of course different possibilities to gain
access to the object to be observed. However, in
some cases there might be a high wall or
security personnel or even other circumstances
which prevent you from entering certain
premises in order to install corresponding
surveillance devices. In this case we recommend
the PKI 5785, because this Hi-tech ball is a
relatively simple equipment. The lower half of the
transmitter ball is 4 times heavier than the upper
half. Because of the gravity the heavy lower half
always remains on the ground. The upper half is
provided with 3 video cameras with pinhole
lenses at an angle of 110°. This guarantees that
always a picture is transmitted from the desired
direction. This of course also applies for the
built-in directional microphones. The built-in
audio/video transmitter with 4 channels transfer
the signals to the LCD monitor delivered with the

PKI 5785 within a frequency range of approx. 5,8
Ghz. up to a distance of approx. 200m and
continuously up to 3 hours. Optionally we can
also offer an additional remote control in order to
activate the transmitter ball only if required and
such enabling observations for several weeks.
Specifications:

PKI 5790

Miniature Video Repeater
Small-sized video cameras with integrated
transmitters only have a limited transmission
range. Wherever larger distances to receiving
points have to be covered, it is necessary to use
a repeater-station. Our PKI 5790 is the right
solution for such applications. It receives the
standard video signal within the 1.2 GHz range
and transfers this into the 2.4 GHz range. With its
max. output power of 4 Watts and the 18 dbi
directional Yagi-antenna, a max. distance of up to
20 km (depending on surrounding conditions) is
possible. PKI 5790 especially has been
developed for disguised purposes, and its
smallest dimensions are perfect for any mobile
operation. Power supply of the PKI 5790 is
provided by a separate 12 V rechargeable battery
and/or mains adapter/charger. For the reception
of the signals we recommend our PKI 5755 A/VReceiver/Recorder.

Specifications:
• incoming: - 1.2 GHz-range
• outgoing: - 2.4 GHz-range
(other frequencies - like 1.3 GHz
to 2.6 GHz - are available upon

PKI 5795

Audio / Video Scanner
With the PKI 5795 every audio and video signal
within the frequency range of 900 to 2520 MHz
can be received. Automatic scan mode allows
easy localisation, but manual scan is also
possible. In both modes, disguised wireless
cameras can be found and the received signals
will be transmitted to the integrated LCD-monitor
and speaker. Of course the PKI 5795 can not only
be used for detection purposes, but is also a
versatile tool for a mobile observation system by
just combining one of our small wireless
cameras with this scanner.. Optionally an
external directional antenna can be connected for
achieving larger ranges.

Video and Night Vision Systems
PKI 5800

AV Night Vision Set
This high-tech A/V system developed by PKI
exceeds everything that might be available on the
market so far. The reasons for this are very
simple:
1) no low light amplifier (poor video resolution
and expensive)
2) no laser (dangerous for the eyes)
3) weight (portable device too heavy)
PKI 5800 is equipped with a high-resolution
camera connected to an IR-hybrid illuminator for
night vision. This handheld device with
integrated directional microphone allows
observation at day and night up to 200 m
distance at the highest possible resolution.
Several ways of processing of the audio/video
signals are possible, such as immediate
recording, wired transmission to our A/V goggles
or wireless transmission to further external
devices. All kind of monitors are connectable.
This outstanding combination enables every
policeman to survey and control the relevant
situation. Due to security reasons PKI 5800
should be available at every surveillance
operation of customs, police or border patrols.
