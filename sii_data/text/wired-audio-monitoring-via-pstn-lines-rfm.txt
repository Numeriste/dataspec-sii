Wired Audio Monitoring via PSTN Lines
(RFM / TSE 4006)

System Introduction
The room and telephone monitoring system TSE 4006 is developed by GAMMA to allow the audio monitoring of room and telephone conversation via standard PSTN telephone lines. The TSE 4006 is designed to operate without interfering with the normal
functions of the telephone system and to provide the very high speech quality requirements of surveillance operatives. Transmitters use current when operating and
this normally creates a voltage drop in the PSTN line being used. The TSE 4006 receiver is equipped with a special circuit which replaces the current used so that there
is no voltage drop in the telephone line. This makes the TSE 4006 difficult to detect by
automatic central exchange loop current detector systems.

Description
The TSE 4006 is specifically designed for covert audio surveillance operations. The
TSE 4006 has the ability to monitor a room and its telephone line by utilizing the existing telephone system. All room and telephone conversations can be monitored and
recorded from a remote location. TSE 4006 utilizes techniques which have not been
previously used in PSTN line monitoring and consists of two units: a front end transmitter module TSE 4006-TX and an FM receiver combined with a line intercept amplifier TSE 4006RX.

Transmitter
The TSE 4006 transmitter module incorporates a highly sensitive microphone coupled
to a pre-amplifier with a wide dynamic range, fast acting AGC (Automatic Gain Control), and FM-modulator. It is protected against high voltage spikes and calling signals
on the line. The TSE 4006 is available in a variety of forms including a scrambled version TSE 4006-TXS-S or TSE 4006-TXR-S.
Receiver
The TSE 4006-RX receiver is built into a strong aluminum housing containing the FM
receiver, Mixer circuitry and a line intercept amplifier with a high impedance differential input and very high common mode rejection. This assures that the highest possible signal to noise ratio is achieved. The built-in mixer circuitry allows the operative to
listen to either the room conversation or the telephone conversation - or both at the
same time. The receiver TSE 4006-RX is equipped with a de-scrambler module, which
is capable of de-scrambling the signals from TSE 4006-TXS-S and TSE 4006TXR-S.
Outputs are provided for Headphones, Tape/aux., VOX switch and a 600 ohm balanced output for re-transmission on a standard PSTN dial up line or CCITT M1020 line
(leased line).
Applications
A hard wired audio surveillance system is more difficult to detect than a conventional
radio transmission system and is capable of giving better speech quality. There is no
“drop out” of signal, a common problem with radio transmission systems. The TSE
4006 system incorporates some unique features, and is specifically designed for covert operations. The transmitter is to be installed via parallel connection with the target line and can be concealed inside the telephone, behind the wall socket or anywhere with direct access to the telephone line.
The TSE 4006 system is designed to work with PSTN slave lines without amplifiers
and filters.
Typical methods of deployment:
-

During new construction work
Exchanging the telephone
Hard wiring into the telephone line during covert entry
Simulated repair of the PSTN communication network

Audio Level/Line Voltage Meter
The TSE 4006-RX is fitted with an analog meter, which enables the line DC voltage or
the audio dBm level to be measured by switching between the two modes.
Smart Vox with Noise Cancellation
VOX sensitivity can be set on the front panel. The newly developed intelligent VOX
circuitry is equipped with two LEDs for easy setting, and has the capability to distinguish a voice from ambient background noise, increasing the VOX reliability in noisy
environments.
Dual Output
The TSE 4006-RX is fitted with 2 audio outputs; an RCA jack socket with line level
output for tape recorder and a standard 600 ohm balanced telephone line output for
re-transmission of the monitored audio via the PSTN network.

Technical Features
Fitted with CRS System
All transmitters use current when operating. A major problem for most PSTN line parasitic transmitters is the current drawn from the PSTN line that enables the transmitter to function.
If the transmitter draws more than approx. 6 mA, the line status changes from onhook to off-hook. This change in current consumption, even when less than 6 mA, is
easily detectable by counter surveillance methods and indicates an abnormality in the
line. Gamma has developed a Current Re-injection System (CRS) to overcome these
problems. The CRS system re-inserts the current used by the TSE 4006-TX unit which
avoids a voltage drop across the target telephone line. This ensures that the targeted
PSTN line is unaffected by the presence of the TSE 4006-TX unit and makes the system difficult to detect by conventional counter surveillance methods.
Operational Features
Adjustable Off-Hook Threshold Level
The TSE 4006-RX unit is equipped with on-hook/off-hook threshold level adjustment at
the rear of the receiver, which can be set between 10 and 40 Volts.
Parametric Equalizer
In order to optimize the audio quality, the monitored signal is passed through a parametric equalizer with variable boost or cut in the 100 Hz to 10 kHz frequency range
and variable Q.
Activity Indicator
For ease of operation the receiver unit TSE 4006-RX is fully equipped with LED status
indicators.
Options
Standard Transmitter Module
The TSE 4006-TXS is our standard miniature transmitter with built-in microphone.
Extended Microphone Version
On the TSE 4006-TXR transmitter the microphone is mounted on 2 metres of cable,
separate from the transmitter board. This allows the microphone to be placed in the
target room and the electronics package to be in an adjacent room - a technique that
makes it very difficult to locate the transmitter by conventional counter surveillance
methods.

Integrated wall outlet TSE 4006-TXBT-I and External wall outlet TSE 4006-TXBT-W.
Scrambled Versions TSE 4006-TXS-S and TSE 4006-TXR-R
The TSE 4006-TXS-S transmitter uses a Gamma developed, analogue-speech protection system, which ensures the highest possible quality of retrieved speech. A descrambler module in the TSE 4006-RX receiver is able to decode the signals from the
TSE 4006-TXS-S or TSE 4006-TXR-R.
Capacitor Housing Version TSE 4006-TXC
The TSE 4006-TXC transmitter is built into a capacitor housing. which allows the unit
to be deployed inside existing electronic equipment.
