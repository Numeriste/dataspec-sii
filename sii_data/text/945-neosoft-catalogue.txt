GSM/3G Mobile Active Monitoring System
NEOSOFT NS-15-1-SASSl
Purpose:
The system is designed for active real time GSM/ 3G monitoring in the following bands: 850, EGSM/1800,
1900 MHz for GSM and 850, 900, 1700, 1900, 2100 MHz for 3G.
The basic units of the system are GSM and 3G modules which provide communication with the
corresponding types of mobile phones. Each of these units creates a fake BTS with the best operation
parameters (GSM/ 3G) for communication. Since the mobile phone has registered within the fake GSM BTS
ail connections can be monitored by the system. 3Gmobilephones will be downgraded to GSM operation
mode and can be intercepted by GSM monitoring system.

AS.l Deciphering Network Unit
NEOSOFT NS-15-1-DNU
Purpose:
The Deciphering network multi-processor unit is designed as optional equipment
for NeoSoft active, passive and hybrid GSM monitoring systems. It is required for
operation in countries with AS.1 GSM session coding.
The AS .1 coding is a stream cipher which is used to provide over-the-air (OTA)
communication privacy in the GSM cellular standard. As the result, ail OTA data
is covered by the session key KC . When discovering KC, one can restore an entire
GSM session with voice, SMS recording, etc.
The hardware is controlled by a computer which is responsible for the deciphering
configuration and the communication between the AS .1 Deciphering unit and
NeoSoft GSM monitoring system. The AS.l Deciphering unit is a network device
and can be connected to the operator's computer either directly by LAN cable or
wirelessly using any available communication (GPRS, UMTS, satellite link, etc.) or
via highly secured Internet VPN connection.

Purpose:
Direction finder is intended for searching and localizing handsets
operating in EGSM/ DCS and 850/ PCS GSM bands.
It is the optional equipment for mobile or portable active GSM

•

monitoring systems by NeoSoft.
Since the mobile phone is registered by the active GSM monitoring
system and the system's operator activated it's transmitter by the special
software then the Direction finder (DF) can detect the direction of this
transmission. The DF must be tuned to the same ARFCN channel as the
BTS of the GSM monitoring system.From this moment the DF user will
hear the detected sound signais of TDMA sequence natural for GSM

~

telephony. While operating the DF it is necessary to connect it to the
antenna connector of the corresponding range. Rotating the antenna
right or left allows achieve the maximum in signal level reading on the
contrai unit LED or the maximum volume level in the head-phones or
Bluetooth headset.

Catcher then the mobile phone can be released to 3G provider's network or
be downgraded to GSM operation mode. In the last casethe mobile phone can be
intercepted by GSM monitoring system.
It is also possible to make correlation analysis of IMSI/IMEI identities collected in the
different places and estimate actual target's identity. The 3G Catcher is fully
compatible with GSM/3G Mobile Active Monitoring System. It can be used either as
a stand-alone device or be integrated with NeoSoft GSM Monitoring systems.

NEOSOFTinPOINTSMS
Purpose:
The system is designed to send a bull< of advertising SMS messages or even security
messages to handsets in local areas (banks, businesses, railway stations, shops, hotels,
ships, etc.)
The basic unit of the system is GSM module which provides communication with the
corresponding types of mobile phones. It creates a fake BTS with the best operation
parameters for GSM communication. If the mobile phone will try to register within
the fake BTSthen itwill receive required SMS message and will be released to GSM
provider's network. The system has power adjustment feature and a set of directional
aerials to create various operation areas(Private zones).

Features:
The system is aimed to provide SMS service only in the private area accord-

• Full independence from the real GSM provider

ing to the following rules:

• SMS messages are absolutely free for the sender as well as for the
subscriber

• Sends broadcastSMS only to people who corne to the system's working
area (potential business partners);

• Sends SMS to all the GSM mobile phones which are coming into its
working area with no limitations

• Public numbers of mobile phones stay unknown for the operators of the
system;

• Sends SMS to all phone types and different GSM providers

• Personal datais not collected;

• Unlimited text size (amount of characters) gives a chance to send
long texts with detailed descriptions

• The system does not install any software, viruses etc on the processed
mobile phones.

• Possibility to put any text in the "SENDER" ("FROM") field
• Very simple in use with an easy interface

The system may be also useful for govemment agencies and law
enforcement groups. The system can provide circular GSM messaging
in cases of emergency, help to looking for eye-witnesses or giving
instructions to people in disastrous areas.

By utilizing our advertising system the following objectives can be achieved:
• create a special outlook system that detects presence of new handsets in the place of interest and sends advertisement messages to each of them;
• increase the attractiveness of your business to the customers;
• keep interested parties updated about ongoing promotions, sweepstakes, contests, discounts, schedule changes, etc;
• SMS-broadcasting in creative combination with news, finances, sport information, lottery results, and even horoscopes;
• a company of any size can transfer information about its special offers to their existing and potential customers;
• now it is not necessary to be contacted individually to each potential customer. Thus, spending for printed products can be reduced.
