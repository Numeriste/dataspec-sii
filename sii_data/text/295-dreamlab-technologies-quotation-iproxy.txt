1. Fundamentals
This offer is based upon a request of Thomas Fischer of Gamma International as well as on various
conversations between Gamma International, Dreamlab Technologies AG and the end customer.
1.1 Starting point and objectives
During the integration tests in Oman in September 2010 the end customer figured out that not all of the
components of the iproxy infrastructure are under their full control. It is, for example possible that changes of the
Oman-network may occur without their knowledge. Thus, it might occur that ISPs may modify some of the current
configuration. Therefore, the question arose whether it is possible to identify such a modification in the network
setup by monitoring the whole iproxy infrastructure.
From this point of view, a request for an efficient and user-friendly monitoring of the iproxy infrastructure including
all components of the systems was derived. This requirement is discussed and a proposal for solution is
described in this offer.
The solution covers several aspects:
•

All components of the iproxy infrastructure and all services running on the systems will be monitored.

•

For defined critical outages of the hardware components, processes and/or services the system will send
SMS- and/or e-mail-alarms to persons defined beforehand.

•

A web-based management GUI offers a wide range of views, which allow the operators to easily identify
system issues and outages.

•

A set of reports offers possibilities to retrieve condensed information on the system like statistics on
outages or performance problems.

3. Project workflow and deliverables
3.1 Overview of the actual iproxy infrastructure
3.1.1 Network infrastructure for the iproxy infrastructure
In 2010, the infection proxy solution for the fixnet part was implemented on-site in Oman. The picture below
shows the network infrastructure and the setup as currently implemented.

Illustration 1: Current topology of the network with infection proxies

During the tests in Oman, the end customer asked for a monitoring possibility of the iproxy infrastructure with the
goal to identify changes and modifications of the setup.
The following quotation specifies the elements of the proposed monitoring system.

3.2 Overview of the monitoring solution

The proposed solution is based on the implemented iproxy infrastructure. The monitoring will cover all hardwareand software components of the iproxy infrastructure, e.g. the management infrastructure, the AAA-probes and
the iproxies. The picture below gives an overview of the elements needed for the monitoring system.

Illustration 2: Proposed monitoring solution:The green dashed lines show the monitoring of the radius probes, the
iproxies at the internet exchanges and the management server. The monitoring server detects and stores events
in the monitored infrastructure and sends alarms by SMS and emails to the responsible technical staff members
upon defined cases. The second monitoring server (in light blue) indicates the redundant monitoring cluster.

3.3 Functional overview of the monitoring solution
The proposed monitoring solution is based on Nagios-Munin, the state-of-the-art monitoring software.
Components to be monitored
The following system components of the iproxy infrastructure are subject to monitoring (see picture 2 on page 8):
•

the management server at the LEA (ADMF)

•

the 2 AAA-probes for the IP-access and WIFI

•

the 2 iproxies at the internet exchange

For the named components the monitoring system will be configured with agents to monitor several layers (see
Picture 3 below):
Hardware Layer Monitoring:

Important hardware components will be monitored like disks, CPUs, raidcontroller, power (on/off) or network cards, plugging / unplugging of cables.
For these elements checks will be made in order to control the hardware
condition .

System Layer Monitoring:

System processes are monitored and important data and aspects like disc
capacity, RAM capacity, CPU performance etc. will be checked. Errors and
system critical values (for example: disc capacity over 80% etc.) are detected.
Regular alive-checks are done.

Application Layer Monitoring:

An overall process check on each machine gives important information on the
overall condition of the monitored element.

Illustration 3: The proposed monitoring consists of several levels. On the lower levels hardware components,
system and application processes are monitored. On a higher level services (like iProxy 2) are monitored.
Detailed presentations of the graphical user interface are shown in appendix in ch. 10, p. 23ff.

However, smart monitoring does include more than monitoring all the components. Only when combining and
understanding the components as a whole service the results of a monitoring are good results. Thus, the
monitoring is service-oriented where the components and its dependencies are included.
In our proposal we introduce two higher layers of services, while the first reflects “a site” (for example the NDP1).
Thus, it is possible to easily drill down information concerning site “NDP1” or site “management infrastructure
(ADMF)” and hence, to identify in the monitoring whether the service of site “NDP1” is correctly working or not.
On the highest level, dependencies between the sites are introduced to build a view of the whole service. In order
to introduce this view related to monitoring, deep insight in the real implementation of a service is needed. As a
result, the user gets qualified information about the service level of the monitored service, thus, reaching a level
where monitoring is intuitively understood – also by non-application specialists.

Alerting and alarming
The monitoring system allows to set up alerts on nearly any kind of event. Typical alerts are outages of hardware
components, exceeding of critical values like disc space usage, timeouts etc. Based on alerts, alarming
mechanisms can be used to send an alarm by email or SMS to persons defined beforehand.
Example for an alarm: assuming a network cable is unplugged at NDP1. The monitoring system triggers an alarm
set up beforehand, which alerts the person in charge at LEA (for example by SMS or Mail).

Views (for details also see the appendix on page 23)
The monitoring system will offer a set of views, which show the aspects of the monitoring system as described in
the previous section, and which are helpful when analysing problems, alerts and outages. Detailed examples and
short descriptions of the views are shown in the appendix on page 23ff.
View

Short description

Tactical view

The tactical overview always shows all service and host checks that are performed
and gives an overview of the condition of the whole system and its corresponding
services. The monitoring platform is service-aware and knows which services
depend on what underlying systems. In case of outages or problems, this screen
directly indicates the elements that need treatment.

Service details

The service overview pane dissects the rendered services in its components. Each
component is actively monitored and in case of failure, the operator knows exactly,
which element is causing the issue.

Host details

The host details pane shows all hosts participating in the system and its condition.
From this screen the operator can drill in the detailed checks and their corresponding
history.

Host group summary

Modern services usually need more than one host to be rendered correctly. In the
host group pane the operator is shown the logical function blocks including its real

information
Trend host view

With the trending tool the overall availability and availability trends are being
calculated in a format, which delivers the perfect basis to calculate SLA aspects.

Trend service view

This example shows service outages on a timeline. Perfect for reconstructing events
or managing outages.

Service availability

This feature of the monitoring platform calculates on a per-host-basis the detailed
service availabilities in a defined timespan.

Overview

With the Nagvis extension the whole monitoring infrastructure can be combined with
informal layouts and graphs. This tool is of great value and helps visualising the very
low-level technical measurements by transforming them into very informative and
high-level views enabling the operator to quickly identify potential problems.

Map overview

Combining multiple views and graphs leads to considerably reduced debugging
times. From the very high level layouts, the operator can access the rack view and
therefore see, where problems need treatment on a physical layer.

Site Overview

This is another example of a very high-level and highly condensed system view.
Bear in mind that the informal layouts get enhanced by the various real time checks,
which, when correlated and condensed, lead to one working or not working
statement per logical unit.

Virtualized system

With this monitoring platform, even virtualised systems can be dissected and shown

in informal graphs.

System detail overview

This example shows all actual performance consumptions on all systems on one
single page.

Screen overview

With the additional performance graphs, every measurement is shown in detail in tie
series plots. Operators therefore get a very detailed view of every single aspect of a
service and host. With means of the time series and the operational knowledge the
operators get a very detailed insight on any impact from any service providing the
systems.

10.2 Alerting and monitoring infrastructure
10.2.1 Nagios Tactical Monitoring Overview

The tactical overview always shows all services and host checks that are performed and gives an overview of the
condition of the whole system and its corresponding services. The monitoring platform is service-aware and
knows which services depend on what underlying systems. In case of outages or problems this screen directly
indicates the elements that need treatment.

10.2.2 Nagios Service Details

The service overview pane dissects the rendered services in its components. Each component is actively
monitored and in case of failure the operator knows exactly, which element is causing issues. Of course, a history
of all events is being kept.

10.2.3 Nagios Host Details

The host details pane shows all hosts participating in the system and its condition. From this screen the operator
can drill in the detailed checks and their corresponding history.

10.2.4 Nagios Host Group Summary

Modern services usually need more than one host to be rendered correctly. In the host group pane the operator is
shown the logical function blocks including its real time monitored condition. This is a great tool for first line
diagnosis of problems or anomalies.

10.2.10 Nagvis Overview

With the Nagvis extension the whole monitoring infrastructure can be combined with informal layouts and graphs.
This tool is of great value and helps visualising the very low-level technical measurements by transforming them
to very informal and high-level views enabling the operator to quickly identify potential problems.

10.2.13 Nagvis Rack Overview

Combining multiple views and graphs lead to considerately reduced debugging times. From the very high level
layouts the operator can access the rack view and see where problems need treatment on a physical layer.

10.2.14 Nagvis Site Overview

This is another example of a very high-level and highly condensed system view. Bear in mind that the informal
layouts get enhanced by the various real time checks, which, when correlated and condensed, lead to one
working or not working statement per logical unit.

10.2.17 Munin Screen Overview

With the additional performance graphs, every measurement is shown in detail in tie series plots. Operators
therefore get a very detailed view of every single aspect of a service and host. With means of the time series and
the operational knowledge the operators get a very detailed insight on any impact from any service providing the
systems.
