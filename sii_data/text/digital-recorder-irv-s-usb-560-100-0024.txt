Digital Recorder – IRV-S USB
General
The IRV-S is a two-channeled digital audio recorder. Recording takes place on Compact Flash-Discs, Micro
Drive-Discs or any other storage media in the Compact Flash-format type I, which support the IDE Mode 2
interface. Recommended are Compact Flash memory cards provided by ScanDisk. The maximum recording time
depends on the data carrier’s storage capacity, but, however, up to 1000 hours can be achieved.
The IRV-S saves the data to a digitally encrypted record. Only the delivered software enables the decoding into a
common WAV-format.
