The Challenge of Packet Data Collection
from Satellite Communications Space
Segment and Effective Solutions
The provisioning of intelligence collection and processing of
satellite communications (Inmarsat, Thuraya, VSAT etc) is
one of the emerging challenges of today. This session will
give an overview of original solutions for the collection and
processing of packet data satellite services (Internet, VoIP,
FoIP) at all layers of the Open System Interconnection
model.

SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONS - GENERAL STRUCTURE

OVERVIEW OF SATELLITE COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS

OSI MODEL OF SATELLITE SYSTEMS

SATELLITE MONITORING SYSTEM

MAIN CHALLENGES OF SATELLITE MONITORING
1. Absence of common synchronization source and system parameters
2. Possible absence of one satellite direction
3. Non-standard (not defined by interchange protocols) delay between channels
when signals are recorded in different points
4. Presence of echo

SYNCHRONIZATION PROBLEM

The problem source: All signals are synchronized at the satellite’s aperture
Target signals come to the monitoring center with unknown delays

Maximum allowed distance divergence when synchronization
in Thuraya network is provided: <127 km (GMR-1 04.008)
Proposed solution of synchronization does not depend on distance
from target to monitoring center
Distance divergence of more than 5000 km should be provided

FORWARD/RETURN CHANNEL ABSENCE PROBLEM IN SPOTBEAM SYSTEM

The problem source 1:
Absence of forward channel

Absence of time/frame/message synchronization
(FCCH, BCCH, AGCH in Thuraya network)
(NCSS, NCSA in Inmarsat)

The problem source 2:
Absence of return channel

Absence of channel request, positioning and
ciphering messages
(RACH, FACCH3 in Thuraya network)
(MESRQ, SUB in Inmarsat)

PROBLEM OF SIGNAL RESTORATION IN THE BACKGROUND
WHEN SIDE ECHO IS ABSENT
Echo signal is used to restore parameters for demodulation
and decoding

Unavailable parameters are restored by signal’s intellectual analysis system

Restoration of absent transmission from echo signal
(so that all information content is retrieved)
Application of special signal processing algorithms to restore
echo signal in the background

Application of special speech processing algorithms allows
(in some cases) the restoration of both sides by means of
the echo signal

-Extract of information from echo

- Restoration of signal at echo background

Packet collection challenges at upper levels of OSI model
1. Possible absence of one satellite direction – FC or RC
2. Impossibility to make a request for lost data
3. Violation of multimedia synchronization streams
4. Violation of synchronization commands when satellite directions
are collected at different points
5. Possible absence of information of used protocols
6. Possible implementation of non-standard ports (SMTP, proxies for HTTP)
7. Problem of HTML page assembling. Absence of information on destination
point for HTML page fragment.
8. Problem of HTML page fragment caching and tracking of cache changes
9. Problem of tracking HTML page fragments that have moved
