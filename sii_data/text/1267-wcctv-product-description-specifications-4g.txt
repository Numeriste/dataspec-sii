Live and recorded video images can be viewed from a dedicated monitoring station, laptop, PDA. iPhone, iPad
or Android device. Up to 6 separate connections can be made simultaneously to any system. So it's not just
a portable camera system, you also have portability in how you view those images.

is shot gun resistant, has an 18x, 28x or 36x optical zoom function and has a flat optic viewing window with
a wiper to provide distortion free images.
