The Ll-5 is a portable surveillance and mediation platform for
Ethernet, IP and MPLS networks. Fanless and fully-embedded without

.wi-

m ovin g parts, the Ll-5 integrates solid-state storage with up to four
gigab it network interfaces, and uses less than 11W of power. The Ll-5 is
sma ll enough to fit in a backpack with all the features of systems many

t imes its size and twice its price . Now in its third generation, the Ll-5 is the most flexible
and econom ical IP probe ava ilable, and also one of the most widely-deployed tactical probes
worldwide. Paired with Packet Forensics
