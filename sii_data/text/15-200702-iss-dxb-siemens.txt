Did you ever wonder …
If the person flying into your country at a particular date every month is visiting
his company’s headquarters?
" but the date sometimes falls on a weekend…
If the irregular high banking transaction of a certain person is related to an
inheritance from his just passed away mother?
" or from the art theft last week…

Sure, you are able to answer these questions
But do you have
- the time ?
- the staff to follow every seemingly unimportant hint ?

… to get a report within minutes:
•

Track all major contact persons of the main militant group in the
country using this data sources:
- E-mail, Fax, SMS
- Phone calls
- Bank transfer data
- Flight booking details
- Credit Card records

•

Identify new suspicious persons and organisations regarding money

Intelligence Applications
Intelligence Mining: Pattern Profiling

Principle:
•

Pattern Profiling includes patterns with
- behavior
- communication
- movement
- relationship

•

A target usually has its individual behavior which only changes slowly
over time

•

Sudden changes in target behavior
- Generates an alarm
- Draws the analyst’s attention

Intelligence Applications
Rule Based Queries

To construct complex database queries without database knowledge

•

The analyst constructs a semi-graphical model of the query

•

The system retrieves all instances from the database that fulfil the Rule

Suspect A

Owner

•

Account A

Example:
$20,000

Search the database for all
occurrences where two suspects

b) use a bank account to transfer
money via a third party

$20,000
Suspect B

Intelligence Applications
Indexing: Full Text Indexing and Retrieval

•

Indexing is performed on all sorts of text documents, like
- Web pages
- Word documents, Transcripts
- Emails, SMS, Chat protocols
as well as on data base records in general

•

The Indexing process constantly runs in the background

•

The analyst can quickly search in a Google-like manner for words or phrases

•

Typical response time < 1 sec

Topic Spotting in the text domain

How does it work?
•

The Analyst defines a number of topics, e.g.:
- Drug Trafficking
- Corruption
- Money Laundering
- Kidnapping

•

The analyst provides sample documents containing typical
contents for each topic

•

The Intelligence Module is trained on the samples

•

After training the Intelligence Module classifies documents
with unknown contents according to the trained classes

•

Topic Spotting is language independent
