Cyber Security Monitoring

Packet Capture's lnconvenient Truth

ln today's world, every organisation is exposed to the
risk of cyber attack and data loss. With the network
now being critical to almost every organisation,
business leaders have an absolute obligation to

Network security systems that use software-based
techniques to acquire packets from the wire drop some
of them. The truth is that software-based NICs were
never designed to be used to acquire packets from the
wire; they were designed to move data between servers

protect customer information, corporate IP and the
integrity of the network - because the consequences
of not doing so are extremely serious . The days of
tick-box compliance for PCI, HIPAA, SOX or any other
government mandated security requirement are gone.
Today, it's about reputation, brand and corporate risk
which demand a very different approach to network
security.
Endace Network Monitoring
and Recording Fabrics

visibility into both internai
and external cyber security
threats on high-speed and
ultra-high-speed networks.

and hosts . Our testing has shown, with alarming
consistency, that at line rates over 2Gb/s it's almost
impossible to trust systems that aren't built using
purpose-built hardware. Endace Systems are designed
and built to capture packets, without data Joss on highspeed links.

"If you haven t got

every packet, then
any analysis that
you do is pointless"

They use a distributed
'fabric' of passive systems
to analyse network traffic
in real-time . Not only does
every packet get analysed, but they also get recorded

to a local storage buffer to enable retrospective forensic
analysis and archiving for evidentiary purposes.

If you have any doubt as to whether accuracy of
packet capture matters then consider this:
The Conficker worm is 57KB in size. Based on a
standard Ethernet frame (1, 518 bytes), Conficker is
carried in approximately 37 packets, any one of which
could potentially contain the signature that an IDS
needs to see in order to trigger an alert.
On a 50% loaded 1Gb/s link, packet loss of 0.00002 %
could cause a system to miss the critical packet that
triggers the alert. So forget '5 nines'; in reality, nothing
less than 100% capture is acceptable in the world of
signature-based network security.

If you're already at 2Gb/s,
or you can see 2Gb/s on the
horizon, and you are using
a software-based system,
then you should be treating
the output of your network
security systems with
extreme caution .

Reducing Mean-Time-To-Resolution
For many organisations, being alerted to security
events is one thing; being able to analyse then perform
remediation on them when they are coming in fast
and furious is quite another. To make the processing of
security events more efficient, Endace Security Manager
incorporates a unique workflow engine that enables
engineers to investigate events efficiently, without
compromising accuracy.

• View the event in context using Endace Analytics and

Extract the raw packets of interest using our data

lt's quite clear that the volume of events being thrown
at security operation centre teams isn't going to start
diminishing any time soon, so ensuring that your
system is doing everything it can to help accelerate the
process of investigating events is a smart move. We're
committed to help reducing MTIR with every new

Integrated vulnerability scanning
As well as knowing what's travers1ng your network,
it's equally critical to know what systems should and
shouldn't be live on your network in order to stop
hackers, viruses and malware from exploiting potential
weaknesses. Misconfigured networks and unpatched
machines are still the most common cause of security
breaches and, despite the vigilance of IT staff, these
vulnerabilities pose a constant threat.
By integrating a market-leading
vulnerability scanner into the
system architecture, organisations
cannot only consolidate hardware in their data centres,
but can also leverage the power of the EndaceProbe's
write-to-disk capability to capture any traffic going to
(or from) systems that are outside of an organisation's
trusted white list.

The last word on value
The benefits of deploying an Endace Fabric extend well
beyond the ability just to see everyth1ng. They 1nclude:
• Reduction in hardware footprint
• Rapid integration
• Application agility / reduction in time-to-value
• Roadmap to 1OOGb/s
Endace Monitoring and Recording Fabrics are unique
and are being rapidly adopted by organisations across
the world that recognise the need to see everything on
their networks.
