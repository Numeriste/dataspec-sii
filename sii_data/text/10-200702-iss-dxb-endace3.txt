For captured communications to be credible evidence in a prosecution, it must
be shown that a robust and reliable method was used to intercept that
information. It is vital that a common yet undetectable technology is implemented
to guarantee 100% capture of target flows on IP networks. After all, information
is only as reliable as its source.

Q&A

How much do a few bytes
weigh?
! Electronic communications on IP networks:
• Weightless: Exists only "in the ether! of the Internet, between 2
endpoints (people at computer terminals, laptops, PDAs, VoIP phones)
• Difficult to target: No physical circuit to be intercepted, not even any
virtual circuit to be intercepted. No simple "wiretap! like a phone.
• Fragmented: The communications are carried using a "connectionless!
network – they can be split over many different routing paths.

Can you rely on electronic
evidence?
! Depends on local legislation:
• In some cases, yes, recordings of electronic communications can be
lodged as evidence for prosecutions.
• In other jurisdictions it is not admissible as evidence.
• However, it can provide law enforcement with useful intelligence
("probable cause!) to enable an investigation.

! The need is high, and the need is now:
•
•
•
•

Unfortunately, we now face threats to public security in many countries
Criminals are becoming increasingly intelligent at communicating covertly
The cost of failure is high (in lives, in reconstruction)
Well equipped and well informed Law Enforcement Agencies are crucial

Requirements of intercept
infrastructure
! Invisible: No-one on the network should be able to detect an
interception, nor detect that the systems exist (ie. Must be hackproof)
! Secure: Only authorised persons shall have access to the
mediation layer, which securely controls the intercept infrastructure.
! Lossless: Must guarantee accurate recording of every byte of data
to/from the targets.
! Manageable: Must be able to be deployed and controlled
throughout large carrier networks, nationwide.
! Responsive: Intercepts must be implemented promptly after
receiving a lawful request.
! Reasonable cost: Must provide a sound return on investment.

Endace infrastructure for LI on IP
networks
!Internal network operations to
intercept and record traffic are
separated from the mediation
layer(s). (ie. See ETSI model)
!The infrastructure is applicationagnostic (any traffic analysis
applications and LI mediation
systems can be layered on top)

!Each analysis/intercept
application is securely separated
from the others.
!The infrastructure asset can be
leveraged for the service
provider!s network management
purposes, generating an ROI for
them:
• Manage service delivery
• Offer revenue-generating

How do you collect the data?
! Endace network monitoring probes are connected to the network by
passive taps.
• They are invisible to the network, and have no MAC or IP address.

! Lossless high-precision recording to disk is guaranteed by Endace!s
DAG technology.
• All packet time-stamps are accurate to <100 nanoseconds.

! Deployed at the "edge! between the core network and access networks,
individual lines can be targeted, and all traffic in/out is silently mirrored
and recorded to disk.
• This includes all network signalling information, all "session! setups/teardowns and the full content of all communications.

! Supported network types: Ethernet, ATM, PoS, PDH/TDM
• The monitoring infrastructure can tap at any point in the carrier network.

How heavily do those bytes weigh?
! All communications are completely captured and accurately recorded,
so there can be no doubt of the activities/communications of the
target.
! We have the data stored in a reusable format, so it can be analysed
and reassembled using many different tools.
! It is now only a question of the legal environment in which we operate.

Q&A
! What about protocol and session reassembly?
•

•

•

The recorded traffic is delivered natively by Endace monitoring probes as either
standard PCAP files, or Endace Record Format (ERF).
This provides a "raw! record of all activity of the target without any modification.
A wide range of applications, commercial & open source, are able to use these
files and reassemble the session content, enabling visibility into the content of
the user!s activities. (Email, IM chat, webpages, etc.)
The LI mediation layer chosen is able to reassemble the raw traffic into the
format necessary for easier analysis by the LEA. (eg. Summary of VoIP
sessions made)
