10/100 Port Aggregator Tap
Net Optics Port Aggregator Taps provide ultra-efficient access to critical links. This
pioneering technology enables any monitoring device to simultaneously monitor a
full-duplex link – using only one NIC per device.

Technical Specifications:
Operating:

Typically, full-duplex monitoring with a network tap requires two NICs (or a dual channel
NIC) – one interface for each side of the tapped full-duplex connection. The Port
Aggregator Tap combines and regenerates these streams, sending all aggregated data out
one separate passive monitoring port.

Operating Temperature: 0ºC to 40ºC

For cases where the NIC’s capacity is exceeded – for instance, if there is a traffic burst,
and the 100 Mbps NIC is now receiving 140 Mbps of traffic – port buffering is offered as
a key unique feature to help prevent data overload. Net Optics’ Zero DelayTM technology
ensures that any loss of power to the Tap is transparent to the network, and does not
affect the flow of traffic through the Tap – eliminating packet delay and loss as potential
security issues.

Redundant Power Supplies:

Storage Temperature: -10ºC to 70ºC
Relative Humidity: 10% min, 95% max, non-condensing

Mechanical:
Input: 100-240VAC, 0.5A, 47-63Hz
Output: 12V 1.5A
DC Power Supply: Input: -48V DC @ 5Amps
DC Receptacle: Terminal peak, 12-14 guage wire
Dimensions: 1.125” high x 9.125” deep x 4.5” wide

All network and monitoring cables necessary for plug-and-play deployment are included.

Cable Interface:

Passive, Secure Technology

22-24 AWG unshielded twisted pair cable, CAT5/CAT5E
Link Distance Supported: 100 meters

Copper Cable Type:

• Supports full-duplex monitoring with a single NIC, increasing monitoring efficiency
• Two megabytes of memory prevents data loss during excessive traffic loads
• Provides complete full-duplex visibility at 10 or 100 Mbps without data stream
interference or introducing a point of failure
• Unique Zero DelayTM technology every packet goes through without delay, even
if power is lost to the Tap
• Compatible with Mid-Span Power over Ethernet (PoE) applications
• Passes all traffic (including errors) from all layers for comprehensive
troubleshooting
• No IP address is needed for the Tap or monitoring device, enhancing monitoring
security
• Redundant power ensures monitoring uptime
