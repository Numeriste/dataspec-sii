Radio Microphone

OC07

Komcept Solutions - in conjunction with Ocean Communications is pleased to present the OCO7 digital scrambled radio
microphone, a member of its family of small surveillance devices.
The OCO7 digital radio-microphone provides a
discrete solution to audio surveillance. The small
transmitter (50mm x 30mm x 6mm thick) is
housed in a rugged aluminium casing for easy
deployment.
Remote control of the transmitter from the
supplied receiver allows real control over its
features, frequency shift, output power and audio
gain to ensure that, in all situations, optimum use
can be made of the hardware.

The transmitter can be pre-set to 3 separate frequencies (within 1MHz) anywhere in the
band 300MHz to 1GHz, making it suitable for most applications.
The FSK output is digitally scrambled to ensure that transmissions are not overheard
providing that extra level of security.
It's small size and versatility make it suitable for use in very small, quick-plant situations as
well as more strategic, longer term operations.
The USB and ancillary sockets built into the receiver allow remote control and monitoring
of multi-transmitter systems.
