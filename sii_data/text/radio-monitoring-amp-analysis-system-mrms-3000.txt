Radio Monitoring & Analysis System - MRMS 3000

The radio monitoring & analysis system MRMS 3000 has been developed for
operational services. It has got a modular set-up and is used for swift radio
monitoring within a frequency range from 25 MHz to 3 GHz.
Rapid FFT analysis allows of high-speed search run of ca. 20 MHz/s. Downstream
monitoring receivers enable listening-in and recording of up to four signals
simultaneously. Minimum response time between start of search run and
activation of monitoring receiver is ca. one second.
By adding another search receiver, the frequency band can be extended to the 100
kHz to 25 MHZ range. Within this range, the search run speed is only 45 steps/s
(i.e. step size of 12.5 kHz at 562.5 search run speed).

An easily operated software controls the system and assures the following
functions:
• frequency band monitoring in search mode (search mode)
• analysis of radio signals
• demodulation and decoding of more than 100 standardised protocols
The system consists of:
• one broadband and narrow band receiver each
• up to 4 monitoring receivers
• a software-based demodulator, decoder and analyser
• a control processor
• aerial units (corresponding to respective frequency range)

Operating modes
1. Search mode
Frequency search run with two adjustable cut-off frequencies. Parameters are
modifiable (step size, reception level). Found reception signals will be stored in a
frequency table.

2. Analysis of radio signals
A special software decoder takes on the analysis and demodulation of radio
signals.
