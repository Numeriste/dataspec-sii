Challenge 442: Smartphones
What's Good
• Image capture with geolocation information
• High forensics value
• Useful law enforcement applications
• And more
But: SmartPhone create law enforcement and
Intelligence Gathering Challenges
10 T O t a r f S e g i e s x

Challenge #2: Smartphones
Why?
1) Call set-up not visible to telecoms.
2) Non-regulated third party based
3) Little if no call detail records kept
4) M o s t traffic peer-to-peer
5) T h i r d party servers located out of country
6) Traffic likely to be encrypted
7) Emerging product market for criminals and terrorists
And timely smartphone vendor support!!!

Challenge #3: Encryption

• Encryption Products are Available at Low Cost $ 5 0 ) or Free with
Easy Installation for Almost any IP Enabled Smart End-Device
Yielding End-To-End Encryption
• M a n y P2P, Social Networks, Webmail and VoIP Services (Skype) are
Encrypted
• Tr a d i t i o n a l Lawful Interception Solutions cannot Provide Content
De-Encryption and Encrypted Content is Useless to LEA/IC
• C a n ' t Block All Encrypted Traffic!

LEA/IC Methods to Defeat Encryption
1. C r a c k the Encryption Code (256 and 1024 Bit Keys)???
2. C o e r c e the Private Key Holder (Certificate Authority) to Turn
the key over
3. M a n - i n the middle attack:
4. I n t r o d u c e weakness in encryption standards (NISI issue)
5. I n s t a l l Spyware
6. S n a r e the messages before they are encrypted!!!
7. O r just collect the Metadata

Internet Challenge 444: Social Media Monitoring
Exponential User Growth (Facebook Example)
• 1 . 1 Billion Subscribers (July 2013)
• 9 0 0 Million Subscribers (June 2011)
• 4 0 0 Million Subscribers (January 2010)
• 6 0 0 Million Subscribers (November 2010)
• 7 5 0 Million Subscribers (October 2011)
• 3 0 0 Million Subscribers use Facebook for messaging (November 2010)

Why Monitor Social Networks?
A. Criminals and Terrorists Use Them To:
- Communicate
- P l a n Illegal Activities
- Fundraise
— Training and More

B. Population Shift From Traditional Telecom Services to Social Network Based
Services
C. N o Intercept Infrastructure (in general) to Support Lawful Interception and
Intelligence Gathering
And More

(Source: Bloggers and the Press)
1. I d e n t i f y TOR Users
2. S h i f t Traffic to "Government Man-in-the-Middle" Router
3. A t t a c k the Targets Installed TOR Web Browser
4. C r e a t e a TOR Users Database
5. I n f e c t The Targets with Intrusion Software
But, you need the assistance of Telecom Operators to identify
TOR users and routing traffic to MITM infrastructure

HTIP 1.1 vs. HTTP 2.0
HITP 1.1 is slow
— Request one at a time, text then image & next image
Each request is acknowledged and processing goes on

HTIP 2.0: Fast, complex and will be an LEA/IC challenge
— Multiple requests, multiple HTML elements per connection
— HTTP headers are compressed
— Encryption mandatory
— IETE determined to Prism-Proof the Internet with HTTP 2.0
— And more

38

TeleStrategies®

Dark Mail Alliance
1. P r i v a c y advocate short comings of third party encryption services like
Lava Bit and Silent Circle:
They store your encryption key and are subject to court orders to
release the crypto keys.
2. D a r k mail alliance started up by Lava Bit, Silent Circle and outside
investors
3. W h a t is the Goal:
— A l l content, subject line and metadata sent encrypted
— Generated keys are only held shortly and never on a server
— Device generated keys and a new one for each email

Solutions to Dark Mail?

Ask The IT Intrusion Vendors at ISS World Middle East
But Both HTTP 2.0 and Dark Mail Alliance Are Works in
Progress

Challenge U10: Regulation Shortcomings
1. M o s t Lawful Intercept Laws are Outdated and It's Voice Circuit
Switched Based
2. G P S Tracking and Conflicting Court Decisions
3. N o "Lawful Intercept Type" Mandates for Portals and Social media
4. N o Inter-Service Provider User Authentication
5. I E T F and Its "Prism-Proof" Internet Goal
And more!
