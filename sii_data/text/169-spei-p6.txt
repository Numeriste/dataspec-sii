Mod. P-6 is a highly integrated device dedicated to the environmental silent monitoring.
Fed to batteries it can catch up an autonomy of beyond three months maintaining a degree of reliability to the
maximum levels. Planned taking advantage itself of the last technologies, the mod. does not fear comparison with
similar equipment, thanks to its smart dimensions and high sensibility.
The voice section has one fully programmable audio path in terms of volume using SMS or simply by a DTMF
keypad (for example you may use the same telephone making the call).
It may be battery operated or directly connected to the same vehicle supply.
The P-6 operations may be triggered by the operator (SMS/DTMF) or automatically when any movement or external input activation has been detected
The device is designed to operate with an external microphone connected by a very resistant cable (len: 1.5 m
or more on request).
The GSM antenna is connected via SMA RF connector.
Digital input and output make possible to integrate the mod. P-6 with external devices.
Audio Output offers the possibility to command an external device with DTMF command.
Mod. P-6 integrates a VOX device with 31 selectable sensitivity levels. This feature work combined with movement
sensors and digital inputs.
Finally, the enclosure – made in aluminium, passivated – offers adequate protection against dust, water and
withstands to most of other environmental conditions.

GSM antenna

The GSM section performs a set of telecom services (TS) according to GSM
standard phase 2+, ETSI and ITU-T. it is compliant with GSM phase 2/2+
The functions of the module are implemented by issuing Hayes AT commands
as detailed in GSM specs level 07.05/07.07
SMS are sent and received accordingly to MO/MT, GSM07.05, PDU and text mode.
Data is transferred at 9600 bps (CSD)
GPRS is a multislot Class 10, mobile station protocol class B.
Automatic hand-over between GSM 900 and GSM 1900
GSM 900, E-GSM 900 and GSM 1800
> -105dB
Class 4: 2W per GSM 900
Class 2: 1W per GSM 1800
