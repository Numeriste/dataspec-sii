GSM/UMTS detection and location system

GSM eavesdropping &. tracking devices pose a threat to security !

Introduction
GSM based eavesdropping and tracking
devices have become by far the most
common technical attack used by both
commercial & government level espionage
agents.
These GSM Bugging devices are available
in many different hides as standard and
can be purchased from the internet by
anyone for as little as £ 25.00 !

At QCC lnterscan we pride ourselves in
being world leaders in TSCM sweep
service provision and in the detection of
eavesdropping attacks so when the threat
of GSM eavesdropping appeared we
started working on a method to Detect,
Locate and Counter it.

Deployment
SE?crchLlqht is powered by a 120v - 240V power supply

and has a 12V in put allow ing it to be used in veh icles .
Se>crchLlqht al so has a hold-u p battery wh ich allows the

un it to be unplugged and moved from room to room
wit hout the need t o power SE?crchLlc;iht down.
Se>crchLJqht m ay be deployed in a stand alone mode or

in cooperative mod es with other equipment or systems.
Some of these deployment modes are described below.

Se>drchLlc;iht's. database determines the
threat level of a suspect device and is
updated on a monthly basis to ensure the
very latest threat information is available.

When a device is demonstrated to be hostile it
can either be activated for precise location
and removal or the SE>drchLIQht operator
can decide to allow or deny it service at will.
White lists of mobiles can be compiled so that
the system does not flag the operators mobile
or other legitimate or authorised mobiles as
possible hostile devices.

When devices are found the SE?dll::hLIQht
operator can quickly distinguish between
legitimate or authorized mobile phones and
GSM bugging devices. Automated processes,
network surveying, system set up and range
selection, device detection and results
analysis make the system effective &
efficient.

Well equipped and highly skilled TSCM teams
provide the best countermeasure to the threat
of eavesdropping, effectively countering even
the highest level threats. Their sweeps should
include thorough physical inspection of the
environment and techn ical counter measures
for each possible type of threat. This is a time
consuming and costly process and also one
which often has to be frequently repeated.
