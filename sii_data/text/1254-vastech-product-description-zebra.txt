The global landscape has undergone enormous changes in the last 15 years.
Known security threats have given way to new ones conceived to avoid detection.
The technologies available to law enforcement and intelligence agencies have
failed to keep pace with the ever-increasing sophistication of the modern global
communications infrastructure.

THE PROBLEM
Gaps in the intelligence picture where criminals slip through.
THE SOLUTION
Third Generation technology from VАSТесh for recording and filtering all
communications from voice and data networks.
VА5Тесhs technology has been designed to store and index as many as З million simultaneous
calls in a central repository. Crucial data can be extracted, processed and analysed with
sophisticated tools.

ZEBRA. shaping the 21st century face of intelligence gathering.
ZEBRA epitomises flexibility. It has the power to record, store and analyse communications
with a footprint that is a fraction of the size of current systems. Using software and industry
standard hardware, ZEBRA takes automated intelligence gathering to a new level.

ZEBRA offers numerous benefits through its range of features
From Triggers to Filters
Agencies have traditionally configured triggers to intercept targets. The blanket
interception concept of the Zebra system enables filters to provide all the
benefits of triggers and afford law enforcement agencies the possibility to
reach back in time to access the communications of targets before they
were identified as targets.
After a major incident agencies can re-construct the intelligence picture
and also create alternative scenarios for further investigation.

Smaller Is Bigger
The design significantly reduces the infrastructure requirements to run and maintain a fully
operational inteHigence gathering platform. A Zebra configured to record 30,000 concurrent
intercepts (1,000 х stereo El ) and demodulate all fax and modem sessions, takes up less
than three equipment racks.
Seamless Scalability
The possibilities for growing the ZEBRA system as requirements change are almost limitless.
A typical system capable of handling 30 000 concurrent channels, 450 000 intercepts per
hour and 6 terabytes of storage per day can be deployed rapidly without the need for
additional infrastructure. The real power vests in Zebras ability to effortlessly manage as
many as З million concurrent channels and store up to 200 million entries in a single
database, allowing for a greater depth of intelligence gathering than before.
Centralised Storage. Distributed sensors.
Remote capture units can be deployed anywhere they are needed and linked to a centralised
data centre and storage facility to provide instant access to and sharing of system-wide
data. Storage capacity can be increased to meet new requirements.
Front End Processing
Zebra allows agencies to automatically migrate selected information to a
central repository. Zebra can perform configured content based processing, such as fax
demodulation, at the remote site, requiring only the results of such processes to be migrated
to the central repository, thus conserving bandwidth.
One API. Many Tools
Zebra provides an API that allows easy integration with third party intelligence
management and processing tools, without the need for
vendor support.

,

Automated processing and extraction combined with industry
standard, off-the-shelf hardware reduces the need for specialised
skills to operate and maintain the system. The system allows
for integration of a range of processing and analytical methods
including relationship analysis, speaker ID, word spotting, Gis,
OCR and more. Zebra also ensures that an audit trail is available
to simplify management.
Network infrastructure indifference
The use of soft switch technology allows ZEBRA to be deployed in circuit and packet
switched networks. 557, 555, ISDN and VoIP protocols can be processed simultaneously,
optimising hardware infrastructure.
Automated signal Classification
Signal inputs can be connected to the Zebra gateway in any configuration. Carriers are
automatically classified and labelled as 557 signalling, 557 bearer or 555 channels. Our
557 CIC mapping application generates suggested pairings for acceptance or modification
by the system administrator.
Zebra can map a large number of channels—something that is impossible to perform
manually without a known CIC Table. These facilities are especially valuable when connecting
unidentified carriers. in a distributed implementation, CIC mapping may be performed
where 557 signalling messages and corresponding content are encountered at different
sites.
Embedded Demodulation
Demodulation is an embedded software application. Agencies can now dynamically
redistribute processing power as and where required - for example over a WAN for distributed
implementations.
