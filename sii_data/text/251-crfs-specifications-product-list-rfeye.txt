CRFS was created in Cambridge in 2007 by successful telecoms entrepreneurs.Our goal was to
develop the world's first cost-effective, commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) system for continuous
remote monitoring and surveillance of the radio spectrum. We brought together a world class
team of RF specialists, product designers and software engineers to meet the challenge. The
result is a truly breakthrough product -the RFeye*.
The RFeyeei s unlike anything else on the market. Its performance approaches that of expensive
high end spectrum monitoring systems at a fraction of the price. We offer RFeye" systems and
turnkey solutions in many different configurations, including standalone units and networks, as
fixed, mobile or man-portable. We have created a number of powerful application software and
database packages for RFeye" and our customers can develop their own applications using our
open API. We supply customers in both civilian and non-civilian sectors, including police and
homeland security services, defence forces, public event venues, spectrum regulators and
network operators. We sell in many countries across Europe, North America and Asia Pacific and
support our customers worldwide.

RFeye Block Down Converter

Seamless 6 GHz to 18 GHz
block down conversion extension
for RFeye node

411,

dllc

The RFeye Block Down Converter (BDC) extends the
frequency range of the RFeye from 6 GHz up to 18 GHz.
It takes a wide band of frequencies and converts them
into a range that the RFeye node can analyse using the full
real-time analysis capabilities of the node.
The BDC is controlled by the RFeye and power is shared with
the RFeye via one of its expansion ports. The RF output of
the BDC is connected to one of the four antenna inputs on
the controlling RFeye node.
The BDC uses the same form factor and mounting options
as the RFeye, permitting standardisation of fitment and
mounting options, and may be CO-sitedwith the RFeye or
mounted remotely.
The BDC is built to the same environmental specifications as
the RFeye and is designed for outdoorlindoor, fixedlmobile
operation, including in hostile environments.

RFeye"

RFeye DF

Single- or multi-channel DF systems
for accurate target geo-location
RFeye DF is a flexible, cost-effective platform for remote
broadband spectrum monitoring and geo-location of target
transmitters of all types. Systems can be configured using a
single RFeye node or multi-channel with the addition of
further nodes. They are fully modular and single-channel
systems can be upgraded to multi-channel for higher
probability of signal intercept.
RFeye nodes are co-located with their antenna arrays and.
for multi-channel systems, with each other. This tight
coupling reduces cable runs and cable losses and
significantly improves performance. Systems are compact
and can be deployed in a vehicle roof box, on a mast or roof
top. Multiple RFeye DF systems can be installed on a site,
perimeter or border to detect and geo-locate the sources of
suspicious signals.
Various DF techniques can be employed. The RFeye nodes
may be individually synchronised to a GPS timing reference
or over a network connection using SyncLinc" connector
modules. Once synchronised, all nodes sweep simultaneously
for precise geo-location based on time difference of arrival
(TDOA) or relative power on arrival (POA) at each receiver
point, as well as sensing the angle of arrival (AOA) based on
signal amplitude. Each technique can be used individually or
all three can be overlaid for high probability geo-location.

RFeye RoofBox

Integrated system
for automated vehicle-based
spectrum surveillance
Wide frequency range: 10 MHz to 6 GHz
(or 18 GHz using RFeye Block Down Converter)

The RFeye RoofBox is a complete pre-integrated vehiclemounted solution designed to allow discreet spectrum
surveillance over wide areas. It comes configured with a
choice of internally mounted broadband omnidirectional
antenna or DF antenna array for AOA (angle of arrival)
direction finding. The system is built into a standard
commercial roof box and includes an RFeye node, antennas,
power controller and back-up battery, and high-capacity
USB memory stick for local storage.
The RFeye node may be pre-programmedwith the required
measurement profile (frequency range(s), measurement
interval(s), resolution bandwidth(s), statistical processing
required, etc.) prior to the start of the survey. This allows
deployment by non-technical personnel where required.
The built-in high accuracy GPS receiver is used to tag the
data received to map data against location. Data is normally
logged to a USB memory stick for easy transfer of data after
each survey, or may also be transmitted over the built-in
GPRSIHSPA modem.
The powerful Linux PC built into the RFeye allows for
conditional data acquisition (inc. if-then-else constructs) and
statistical analysis as the data is collected to maximise the
usefulness of the survey. In addition, a netbook PC may be
connected for monitoring signals in real time during the survey.

RFeye"

RFeye Live

Powerful spectrum analyser interface
for real-time interaction with the
RFeye node
RFeye Live is a standalone application that provides a
state-of-the-art spectrum analyser interface. Using RFeye
Live you can display live spectral data from the node either
local to the unit or remotely via an I P link and can record
data for subsequent playback and analysis.
All traditional spectrum monitoring functions are provided
plus a number of additional functions specific to the RFeye,
such as simultaneous display of signals from up to 4 RF
inputs, dynamic AGC attenuation level and control of signal
processing to be performed by the node.
In conjunction with the RFeye node, RFeye Live displays
sweep and time data and performs audio demodulation from
10 MHz to 6 GHz. This dynamic range can be extended to
18 GHz with use of the RFeye Block Down Converter. RFeye
Live also supports AOA functionality where a DF antenna
array is used together with an RFeye 6 GHz or 18 GHz switch.
RFeye Live enables multiple instances to be run on the same
computer, allowing connections for multiple RFeye nodes, as
well as multiple connections to individual nodes from either
a single computer or multiple computers.
RFeye Live is an invaluable tool for live investigationof the
RF environment both in the laboratory and in the field.

RFeye View

Powerful mapping,

+~ lnteractive analysis of large data sets (up to 2 GB)
a+-

RFeye View is a powerful software package with user friendly
interface for quick and easy visualisation and analysis of
captured data from spectrum surveys using RFeye. Data may
be analysed at any desired geographic resolution, from world
or national level down to individual measurement positions
at street level. Data captured from either fixed or mobile
monitoring networks can be quickly and accurately displayed
and analysed using a variety of tools. For example, the map
view provides an overview of the data in a geographic area,
whilst the spectrum and spectrogram views give alternative
viewpoints on the same data. Selecting data on any one of
the display windows automatically highlights the same data
in the other windows. Spectrum usage may be analysed for
specific combinations of monitoring nodes or networks, for
frequency ranges of interest and signal characteristics (e.g.
peak or average signal strength, or occupancy).
RFeye View is designed to run as a stand-alone application
with no installation of the software required. Flexible
licensing allows the application to be locked to a specific
machine or a specific USB drive to allow usage on different
hosts. Mapping is provided by 0penStreetMap.org and
requires an internet connection.

~+ Designed for very large data sets (multi-terabyte)
.~III,

RFeye DAS is an enterprise level database application for the
management, analysis and visualisation of the very large data
sets collected by modern spectrum monitoring organisations.
Using a proprietary database architecture and data processing
tools designed specifically for this purpose, RFeye DAS provides
fast, fully interactive analysis and visualisation of spectrum
usage from both mobile and fixed monitoring networks.
RFeye DAS concentrates raw spectral data files into a smaller
number of large files for ease of access and management.
Parameters for individual data records are automatically
stored in a relational database to allow efficient searching
and querying. The raw data is processed to form a number of
aggregations over different spatial and time scales, and the
processed data is stored in the database together with
associated geo-location and time data. RFeye DAS is able to
access the raw and processed data, together with the
relational database, to display and analyse spectral data in a
number of different ways, including synchronised map-based
displays, spectrum plots and spectrograms, occupancy plots,
and time evolutions. Data can be selected by any combination
of RFeye nodelnetwork, location, time window or frequency
range, and resolution can be displayed from national level to
individual street location. Many different reports can be
produced and tailored to specific requirements.
