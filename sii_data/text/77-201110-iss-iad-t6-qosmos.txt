Challenges for Monitoring Centers

Fact

Challenge for MC vendors / LEA

1) Exponential growth in HI3 traffic

Difficult to scale

2) Decoding software can be
targeted by cyber attacks and
intercepted traffic can be unclean

Need decoding software with built-in
“Triple R” capabilities and ability to
handle unclean traffic

3) Diversity and complexity of
communication applications and
protocols

Wide protocol support with continuous
updates

4) Increase in of number of targets
and communication services

Go beyond rendering of communications
and add support for investigations based
on automatic pattern analysis

Tripe R: Accurate and Battle-Proof DPI/NI Technology
Tripe R = Resilience + Robustness + Reliability
ixEngine has been designed with Triple R in mind

Resilience
Functioning even under adverse external conditions
(e.g. maliciously forged packets or flows)

Robustness
Performing well during difficult situations (e.g.
incomplete traffic, SYN flood attacks)

Reliability
Adequately decoding traffic even under unusual
circumstances (e.g. tunnels, obfuscated traffic, nonstandard protocol behavior)

Field-proven Technology
Based on continuous
feedback from Qosmos
users in all markets
(telecoms, enterprise,
government) and all regions
of the world

Page 11

Benefits
Battle-proof: Built-in Tripe R = Resilience + Robustness + Reliability
Accuracy: Advanced protocol parsing drastically limits the risk of
missing a target
Field proven: Protocol parsing technology continuously facing reallife intercepted IP traffic:
Wired networks / Mobile networks
EMEA, Americas, Asia

Continuously updated technology
Adapted to new traffic characteristics
New protocols and applications

“Rendering” conversations is
no longer enough: need to
also analyze patterns of
communication
Limited number of LEA

Increasing Number of Targets and Communications:
Use Metadata to Manage the Huge Amounts
3) Relevant metadata only
Sender, receiver, date
Subject, text

Limited volume

Metadata feeds database
Easy to index
Easy to search / find
Easy to correlate, analyze

2) Relevant traffic only
e.g. Webmail

Metadata as an additional
layer to index
communication content

1) Entire traffic of an
Intercepted IP address

Metadata can even replace
communication content

Benefits
Metadata enables automated investigation
To handle the exploding volume of events to track
Without huge increases in the number of agents

Metadata means more agile investigation
Investigate relationships between targets
Use data/text mining tools based on metadata

Storage savings using metadata instead of full packet payloads

Network Intelligence supports
the strategic evolution of monitoring centers

Checklist When Choosing a DPI/NI Technology Partner
Is the company well-established, with a stable customer base and
investors?

Is the business model aligned for strategic partnership?
Is the technology able to handle a large number of protocols,
applications and metadata?
Does the decoding engine support for all leading processor
architectures (Intel, NetLogic, Cavium, Tilera, etc.)?
Is the company able to provide development assistance and
worldwide technical support?
