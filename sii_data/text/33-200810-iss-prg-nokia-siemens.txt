Definition of the Third Generation Partnership
Project
3GPP will provide globally applicable Technical Specifications
for a 3rd Generation Mobile System based on the evolved GSM
core network, and the Universal Terrestrial Radio Access
(UTRA), to be transposed by relevant standardization bodies
(Organizational Partners) into appropriate deliverables (e.g.,
standards).

General Concept
!

One document set as LI solution for 3GPP

!

National LI regulation could be done via one reference
" Clear structure of necessary functions

!

Include the common requirements of all 3GPP members

!

Detailed stage 2 definitions

!

Mainly based on access interception, but service
interception is already fixed for specific services

Common IMS LI
According to the agreement between TISPAN & 3GPP the IMS
definitions out of 3GPP will also be used by TISPAN.
IMS LI definitions have to be drafted in a way that also TISPAN
could use them.
Update of current specification is suffizient
Main question for LEAs: Who will fix the details for CC??
! dynamic triggering seems to be the solution

Dynamic triggering
General questions
1. LI could be activated within one domain within one country
2. LI could be activated within one domain
#on&' care abou' na'ional bor#ers

3. LI could be activated within one country,
domain / operator borders doesn't matter

4. LI could be activated at 'any' access server
no domain or border restriction

1. LI could be activated within one domain within
one country
Current assumption within all LI concepts and standards.
Usual LEA behavior:
! 2ne 3arran' for 5o3n6 cus'omers
! Several warrants for all operators for roamers

2. LI could be activated within one domain
!"#$%&'()*&(+",%&#(%-"#(.&+")!*)/
Operators still hope to get centralized services
Main problem:
" is it legal to send the target list out of the country ?
Solution within EU could be expected

3.LI could be activated within one country,
domain / operator borders doesn't matter
Legal question:
Could Operator 1 activate LI in the Operator 2 network?

"In this way quite dangerous!
German regulations already include this requirement, but no
technical details exist!!

"Get a solution involving the regulators
"trusted government organization

4. LI could be activated at 'any' access server
no domain or border restriction
Practical question:
Could a SIP service provider (e.g. in India) offering this service
in Germany activate interception for CC within Germany??

Problems:
!Sending target info out of the intercepting country

!@ui'e #angerous for misuse by 5anybo#y6

"No technical solution seen,
"too many legal restrictions / problems

Dynamic triggering
Conclusion
If standardization fixes LI dynamic triggering solutions for
question 3, but no concepts for question 4!
Might / Will bring market / marketing advantages for operators
working based on question 4.
Expect statements (explicit or implicit):
Choose our service, you will not be intercepted !!
Worst case:
Operator will go out of the country to prevent LI

Access Interception
My usual s'a'emen'C 9De' i' a' 'Ee access or forge' i'5
Background:
!All information has to go via the access nodes
!No discussion where the service is executed and if the access
is possible at all
!If an UE is able to handle this, a Monitoring Center (MC) has to
support the same functionality

Service Interception
!

Additional requirements for each service
" No clear situation where these services are created/executed

!
!
!
!

Additional LI functions for each service
Always detailed functions " no national regulation for
services
Access to service might be out of the national jurisdiction
"restriction for services usually not possible and also
not recommended
Cost consideration
" Seems to provide for a cheaper MC; but this is not true
" Expensive at the TSP side

LI for conferencing
Whole chapter will become a national option, as the details
might conflict with national regulations.
Currently no CS LI requirements for conference server exists
All these details are fixed for SIP specific conferencing
