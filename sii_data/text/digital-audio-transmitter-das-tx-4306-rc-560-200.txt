Digital audio transmitter – DAS-TX 4306 RC
General description
The DAS 4306 RC, based on SMD technology, is a small remote-controlled audio transmitter
designed for the UHF-BOS-band. Transmission of digital data occurs on the basis of the
transceiver principle. Range of audio data transmission is equal to the range of the remote
control.
Within the transmitter audio signals are digitalized through a 10bit A/D converter and,
afterwards, encrypted with a 56 bit code through the data protection system DES.
Transmission of digital audio data and reception of remote-controlled commands occurs via
same antenna. Uninterrupted transmission of audio data packages enables, at the same time,
reception of remote-controlled commands. All settings can be remote-controlled (On/Off,
output power, power save, internal/external microphone, VOX, channel, address).
