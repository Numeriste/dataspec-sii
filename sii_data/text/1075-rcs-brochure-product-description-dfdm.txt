RCS probing system for ISON PRI channels
General Features
DFDM is a voice and data distributor monitor used to intercept calls on PCM (2 MB) trunks and ISDN PRI.
Signals on monitored links are analyzed 24/7 so that as soon as a target telephone number is recognized, the relevant Call Content (CC)
is saved to disk and an Intercept Related Information {IRI) generated listing all technical information on the call.
DFDM exports CC and !RI to the configured Lawful Enforcement Monitoring Facility (LEMF) using ISDN BRI or PRI connectivity. If there is no
connection, the system buffers all information collected so it can be download later.
The connection between monitored trunks and OFDM is made using passive TAPs that replicate the two directions of the monitored Link on
two different E1 interfaces.

Main features
• Up to four (4) E1 ports to monitor up to two (2) contemporary E1 links.
• Up to twenty (20) active Targets.
• ISDN signal monitoring.
• Portable equipment.
• Egress toward LEMF on BRI or PRI link.
• Configurable egress for Stereo or Mixed modes.
• Integrated O&M terminal.
• Windows Server Operating System
Extra Functions
• Call tracking: a CSV (Comma Separated Values) file is generated daily listing all caller/called numbers and the Timestamp.
• Dynamic configuration: target defining parameters can be changed dynamically, for both Monitored and LEMF numbers.
• Blank call check: if the end_of_call event is not logged in DFDM, the LEMF call will not be closed. This generates a "blank call" which can be
terminated by:
• Voluntary closedown by the O&M terminal.
• Automatic silence detection (configurable).
• Checking if same timeslot is being used by another cal l: this feature prevents the interception of undesired calls.
• Test call: the operator can send a test call to LEMF from the O&M terminal to check connectivity.
• Local Listening: the O&M terminal can be configured to listen to calls using DFDMAudio resources.
• O&M: the Operation and Management terminal is a web application available on DFDM that can be accessed from a remote or local
browser. The following menus are available:
• List/EditTargets
• Send Test Call
• System Configuration
• Diagnostics
• Manual Closedown of egress call
• Application Log view:
• O&M terminal access is password-protected.
