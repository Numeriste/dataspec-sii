Spectrum Scanner (SS)
General Overview
The Spectrum Scanner is a lightweight, portable and state of the art 3G or UMTS spectrum
Scanning Tool. Featuring the latest fast scanning bespoke receiver technology, the SS is a
standalone system designed to work with any
UMTS manipulation system on the market today.
Using optimized scanning technology, the SS
will fully decode all the 3G or UMTS information required for the configuration of a 3G or
UMTS IMSI grabber.
The Spectrum Scanner hides the complexity of
3G system manipulation to provide the information required in a simple easy to understand
format. This has the added benefit of reducing
the training requirement for new operators.
Main Features
• Very fast scan speed using bespoke receiver technology
• Simple Graphical User Interface (GUI)
• Capability to scan all channels in a single frequency band and decode all SIBs for
up to 40 cells across up to 12 UARFCNs within 120 seconds
• Scan nominated channels/UARFCNs
• Scan for nominated scrambling code on specified UARFCN
• Display of total Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) per UARFSN centre frequency
• Display of Received Signal Code Power (RSCP) per scrambling code
• Display of interconnectivity of Neighbours
• Scan all channels within frequency band for channels in use
• Read MIB and all broadcast SIBs transmitted on the P-CCPCH, for each detected
cell

System Modes
