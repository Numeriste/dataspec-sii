10/100BaseT Tap
Net Optics 10/100BaseT Taps supply mission-critical networks with superior
network visibility and security access. The breakthrough design of the Net Optics
10/100BaseT Tap ensures zero impact on network traffic while maintaining
uninterrupted access for monitoring and security devices. These are the world’s first
and only 10/100BaseT Taps offering “zero delay” technology.
Highly sensitive network locations can improve monitoring performance via the
innovative features of Net Optics Taps. Net Optics’ pioneering design ensures that
any loss of power to the Tap is transparent to the network, and does not affect the
flow of traffic through the Tap – eliminating packet delay and loss as potential
security issues.
Without an IP address, monitoring devices are isolated from the network,
dramatically reducing their exposure to attacks. However, the monitoring device
connected to the Tap still sees all full-duplex traffic as if it were in-line, including
Layer 1 and Layer 2 errors.
