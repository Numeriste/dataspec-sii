Audio Wireless Digital Surveillance System
MODEL 6201 series

The TSE 6201 system must be regarded as the most powerful handheld Wireless
Digital Stereo Transmission system on the market today. With an operating range of
up to 4 km/2.5 miles (depending on field conditions), the TSE 6201 system sets new
standards for digital transmission systems.
The TSE 6201 unit combines a range of different functions into one single handheld
and portable system that ensures easy operation in a wide range of surveillance applications. With the TSE 6201 system it is possible to control up to 256 transmitters,
making the system extremely versatile in any surveillance operation.
One particular feature, which is unique to the TSE 6201 system, is incorporated into
the transmitter: when given a remote control command it transmits its status to the
receiving unit. The operator can read this transmitter status in the RX display, thereby being informed of the battery condition, high/low power and mono/stereo and
VOX/Cont. The digital transmission method of coding and encryption eliminates unauthorized listening by a third party. The transmitter is frequency tunable. This
means that in case of interference, both the RX and the TX can be retuned to another channel, where range and audio quality is optimum.
The TSE 6201 transmitter can be connected to a Micro Mains Module (TSE 6007-5)
where long term surveillance operations are required.

TSE 6201-1: Remotely controlled Receiver with digital recorder
The TSE 6201-1 system is the most powerful and versatile digital
stereo transmission system on the market today. It combines a
range of different functions into one single hand-held and portable system.
With the ability to control up to 256 transmitters, the system is
able to operate in multiple locations simultaneously. For secure
transmission, the TSE 6201-1 system uses a special digital
transmission method of coding and encryption, which eliminates
unauthorized listening by third party.

Receiver
The TSE 6201-1 is the next generation digital wireless receiver in a new and compact design. All control buttons are placed on the front of the receiver. The display
has a simple layout, which makes it easy for users to operate and utilize the system
to its fullest potential. The TSE 6201-1 uses minimal current consumption, both
when supplied internally or externally. The high remote control output power, when
powered from an external power source, and the receiver’s sensitivity, provide excellent audio quality in long range operations.

Recorders
This digitally advanced recorder is easily controlled from the front panel of the receiver unit and can be configured to offer anything from 6 to 95 hours of recording,
depending on the sample frequency and compression.
One very unique feature is the supplied software, which is Windows based. All TSE
6201-1 recordings are stored on internal flash using FAT 16 and the Microsoft wave
audio format. This means that each recording can be played via any standard Windows media player. The TSE 6201-1 comes complete with the Wave Checker application designed to detect if a file has been modified after recording. Not only does
the Wave Checker software detect modifications to the actual audio data, but also if
the time or date has been modified, which is imperative when submitting as evidence in court.
