Much like a traditional intelligence agency might recruit and
operate live human assets in physical spaces, in order to obtain
information.
Terrogence specializes in cultivating and operating virtual
entities in online spaces, that access social media platforms
legitimately and act naturally, gaining trust, forming connections and ultimately collecting valuable intelligence from
cyber-sources and cyber-entities of interest.

Our unique web-specific methodology developed organically over
several years, culminating in an
end-to-end WEBINT operations
platform called HIWIRE™ (Human
Interface for Web Intelligence
Research and Entity) "Designed by
WEBINT professionals for WEBINT
professionals.The system's rich
web-specific toolbox provides a
technical mini-solution to every
aspect of the WEBINT production
lifecycle, from general source &
entity management to specific
video frame extraction and annotation, to assisted report generation, all seamlessly integrated in
one user-friendly interface:'

Dedicated to the highest levels of source-accurate, contextually
relevant deliverables, Terrogence employs an array of seasoned
operational linguists, enabling us to cover an unusually wide
swath of critical open and deep web sources in Arabic, Farsi,
Urdu, Hindi, Turkish, Russian, Spanish, French, Polish and more.

On the dynamic web,
Terrogence is more of a
human in the room than a
fly on the wall. We guide
ourVirtual Entities to interact like actual human
users.
Going a step
beyond, we actually elicit
information by carefully
guiding online discussion, often drumming up
interest and facilitating
communication
by
employing
multiple
virtual entities in a single
operation.

11

Terrogence is predicated on the
idea that big data merely provides
context to the specific intelligence
derivatives that can be coaxed
from it with a virtual human touch.
Our HIWIRE™ system, together
with the methodology that
inspired it, embodies a proactive,
human-centric
approach
to
WEBINT, as opposed to a technocentric, passive approach of many
crawler-based
intelligence
solutions and methodologies.

The IED is here to stay, and as deadly as ever.
Terrogence are deep inside the web of terrorist
and insurgent online organization, in the useraccess-restricted portions of networks where old
TTPs are perfected and new TTPs developed.

16

Al-Khemia™ - Al-Khemia™ delivers an in depth
analysis of real-life explosives recipes as they
appear in hard-core terrorist forums and knowledge bases. Exposing these recipes and components is key to rooting-out the IED threat from
its source: the makeshift-labs and workshops
where modern day IEDs are created.
Mobius™ - Mobius™ deals with the deployment
of explosives in Improvised Explosive Devices
(IEDs) of all types, representing current capabilities in manufacturing IEDs, Vehicle Borne IEDs,
body worn IEDs, detonators, camouflage etc.

TGAlertS™ - Outright threats or developments
of imminent interest in the deep web are
disseminated in near-real time via the Terrogence Alert Service (TGAlertS™). In order to
avoid inundating subscribers with the low
threshold of "just news': TGAlertS™ dig a level
deeper, providing context and interpretation.

18

Hydra™ - Hydra™ paints a rich picture of
extremist use of the internet, with particular
emphasis on hardcore Jihadist peer-to-peer
platforms. Each month the report examines
the latest publications, potential targets and
underlying motivations of internet terrorist
activists around the world.

Looking Glass™
Looking Glass™
analyzes the behavioral patterns of prominent Jihadi-web entities who are often
experts in the field of explosives and IED
manufacturing, as well as the main disseminators of such information over the web.

Chimera™ - As terrorist affiliations and other
non-state actors continue to quest after bona fide
WMDs, CBRN online knowledge bases in Arabic
and other languages mature towards critical mass.
Chimera™ monitors the development of this 21st
century threat, exposing salient developments of
CBRN knowledge shared among jihadists on line.

Mitigation of Cyber threats,
like any other, is based on a
multi layered approach. In
the Cyber warfare arena, the
obvious defense layer is that
of technology layer, installing
firewalls,
switches
and
sniffers. The most overlooked
layer is the Intelligence layer:
knowingyourCyberadversaries and exactly what threats
they pose. Intelligence as a
concept is viewed as a very
broad term, mostly associated with military affairs.

20

Today's Cyber battlefield has evolved to become very similar to a "classic"
terror battlefield, with similar intelligence needs and benefits; most of the
actors in the Cyber arena are either non-state actors or state sponsored
actors. These activists and units " live ' ~ communicate and thrive on the internet while targeting mostly non-military targets.

21

The advanced technology and methods that lend
superiority to Terrogence WEBINT operations on
behalf of governments, really come into their own
harnessed to the interests of global corporate
entities who are even more exposed to the web.
Some of the WEB INT services Terrogence supplies to
corporations include:
• Enhanced Due Diligence.
• Compliance Enforcement Monitoring.
• Web Exposure & Vulnerability Assessment
(Virutal Red Team).
• Commercial Sector Cyber Counter-Intelligence
(Finance & Banking, Petro-Chemical & Energy, etc).

23

Over the past several years, Terrogence has honed a
proven methodology for harvesting applied open source
intelligence from web platforms, bridging the intelligence
gaps of our customers worldwide. Our methodologies
and practices have been developed specifically for Open
Source Web Intelligence (WEBINT) and have been tried
and tested over years of intelligence production and
operations.

24

The trainers for our web-intelligence workshops and training
sessions come from rich intelligence and operational backgrounds
in SIGINT, HUMINT, OSINT and HLS strategy.
