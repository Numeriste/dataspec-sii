ЕL/М-21 12 Ground Master is a new family of advanced high resolution radars with
E
unique and outstanding capabilities.
Featuring simultaneous multi-beam technology the radar provides persistent surveillance
I
and instantaneous target tracking over a wide area.
In operational use by military, paramilitary and security agencies, the radars immediately
L
detect, monitor and track all moving targets in the Region of Interest [ROl], such as
walking persons and moving vehicles.
L
These radars feature up to 4 stationary (non-rotating) planar antennas, each covering a
sector of 9 0 .
A
The radars cover detection ranges from 3 0 0 m up to 2 0 , 0 0 0 m for moving persons and
N
ranges of up to 4 0 , 0 0 0 m for vehicles, depending on its version.
The radars are designed for dual use - ground and sea surface surveillance, even in
C
adverse sea conditions.
The
radars are capable of automatically adapting their processing (ground movement
E
detection of sea surface target detection) according to the relevant background mop.
This new radar family reflects ELTA's vast experience in surveillance radars and signal
R
processing, utilizing cutting edge radar technologies.
