Sabre 4000 Hand-held Explosives, CW Agents, Toxic Industrial
Chemicals or Narcotics Trace Detection
The Sabre 4000 - the next generation of hand-held trace detectors - is the only portable trace detector
that can detect threats from explosives, chemical warefare agents, toxic industrial chemicals or
narcotics.
The Sabre 4000 can detect and identify over 40 of these threat substances in approximately 15
seconds. With a cold start time of 10 minutes and weighing approximately 7 pounds including the
4-hour battery, the Sabre 4000 is a small, powerful ally in the ware on terror and drug trafficking.
A detection using the Sabre 4000 means that trace amounts of a target substance have been found
on the item sampled. This in turn means that the item or its handler has been in contact with the
identified substance and the appropriate actions need to be taken.
With the added TIC detection capability and new feature such as the color 3.5” TFT display and
standard 4-hour battery, the Sabre 4000 is still the smallest and lightest portable trace detector
available. Because of their ready availability and relative ease of dispersal, TICs are often viewed as a
more acute threat when protecting against non-conventional weapons. The Sabre 4000 is the only
hand-held trace detector available that can detect all the treats facing you today.

Sample Collection
Proper sample collection is the kea to the success of
any trace detector. The versatile Sabre 4000 is capable
of analyzing either trace particle or vapor samples,
allowing the operator to apply the ideal sampling technique
for the substance suspected.
For example, most explosive and narcotic substances do
not have a strong vapor presence and in the real world are
very difficult to detect by vapor. Therefore, the most reliable
collection and analyses method for those substances is
particle collection.
The nature of CW Agents and Toxic Industrial Chemicals
make vapor sampling more appropriate for these substances.
The Sabre 4000’s ability to analyze either trace particle
or vapor samples lets the operator decide which sample
collection method will yield the most accurate analyses results.
