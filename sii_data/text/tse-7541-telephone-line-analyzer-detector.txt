Telephone Line Analyzer Detector

Features
• Digital Demodulation to confirm that the
telephone line is not passing audio (demodulation
code is upgrade able for new phone systems,
expected to cover 80% of world’s PBX/ACD
phone systems)
• Frequency Domain Reflectometer (FDR) similar
to TDR to check for taps on the line
• NLJD Line Trace Probe for verifying electronic
taps and tracing wires to locate electronics
• Audio Oscilloscope with active input (20Hz to
20KHz)
• High Gain Audio Amplifier (20Hz to 20KHz)
• Digital Multimeter tests voltage, current,
resistance & capacitance
• Bias Generator +-80 VDC, direct digital control to
use with Audio Amplifier, NLJD, and FDR.
• Automatic Internal Pair Switching automatically
performs tests on all pair combinations
• RF Broadband Detector tests lines for RF up to
8GHz
• Multi-Test Database System performs multiple
tests at once on all pair combinations, storing
data in a database for comparison against other
lines and historical comparison

Software

Digital PBX Demodulation
Includes Digital Decoding capabilities for
approx 80% of all digital phone systems.
Upgradeable downloads

NLJD Line Trace Capability
NLJD Line Tracer Probe not only traces lines,
it also detects any electronic devices on the
line-tape

Frequency Domain Reflectometer
Similar to traditional TDR, however, no blind
spots and more consistent resolution
