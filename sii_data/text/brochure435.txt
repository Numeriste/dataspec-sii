In police investigations, telephone
technology must be seen as an asset.
not an obstacle
Mobile phones have become an essential
means of communication in our modern society.
This applies to everyone, including criminals
who make use of phones and sometimes
as an accessory to their illegal activities.
Consequently, a study of phone records gives
police investigators an important resource that
should not be overlooked.
During these times of constant communication,
cellular technologies provide the investigator
with new types of clues and information, thus
creating an additional opportunity for success,
in other words a tool for accomplishing the
investigator's public service mission.

How to get the most out of this line of
investigation?

All investigation and intelligence forces may
have occasion to work with phone data. From
local police departments dealing with petty
or semi-serious crimes (e.g. telephone theft
with assault, telephone harassment, etc ...) to
specialized divisions investigating organized
crime or terrorism, all may need to process
variable amounts of data. In the most extreme
cases, they will need to find just a few phone
calls out of the mass of data generated in urban
centers. When conducted without appropriate
tools, such searches become extremely costly
in terms of investigation resources. In some
occasions however, it is the only hope to
solve the case and must therefore be handled
optimally.

MERCURE makes it possible to analyze
data difficult to process in raw form
The days of the ruler and marker are gone.
While it is impossible to analyze a printed listing
of some 100,000 phone calls, this becomes
a mere formality when appropriate computer
applications are on hand.
Mercure is a software that enables investigators
to analyze very large volumes of data in a
straightforward and intuitive manner. It is the
result of an extensive development always
guided out of concern for performance and
thoroughness.
With Mercure, the amount of data to be
processed is no longer an obstacle.
Moreover, since investigators are not computer
specialists, Mercure has been built around
a simple and ergonomic user interface. Any
user with knowledge of office applications will
be entirely comfortable with Mercure and do
not require any extensive training. Better yet,
Mercure has been designed for progressive
learningfrom basic operationsto most advanced
features.

A high performance tool, adaptable
to all data volumes, can improve the
efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the
investigations

A software for all investigation phases
Mobile phone targeting
In the first stages of an investigation, it is not always possible to determine whether phones were used
when the offense was committed.
Mercure allows conducting this type of search quickly in order to single out the cell phone(s) ultimately
involved and then assist investigators in identifying the corresponding users.

Search for mobile phones involved in calls in specific zones by analyzing the traffic on one

User identification
A specific feature of mobile phones is the added difficulty in tracing them as they may be registered
under a false identity.
Mercure makes it possible to identify users by studying typical behavioral patterns or entourages.

Synthesis and cross-referencing

The showing-up of a single mobile phone number in distinct case contexts is first-rate investigation
information.
Mercure makes it possible to carry out numerous cross-ckecks, not only within the scope of an
investigation underway, but also with prior cases still not solved.

A standardized data import system
The heterogeneity of data, stemming from various phone companies and available in multiple formats,
is the leading obstacle to phone data analyses. For many investigators, it is perceived as a tedious and
unwarranted task.

A logic engine dedicated to data importing
Special emphasis has been given to the way Mercure automates data imports. The application's
logic engine, based on standard format recognition, allows tuning to all particularities of each
phone company (and even to several formats for one same company).
In case of unknown format, Mercure guides the user through a manual import procedure.
