10/100/1000 Tap
1 - 10/100/1000BaseT
Network Link

Get total traffic visibility for 10/100/1000 monitoring and security devices by placing
Net Optics 10/100/1000 (Triple-speed) Taps on critical network links. Network support for
passive and fail-open monitoring of 10, 100, or 1000 Mbps links. This Tap is also ideal for use
with monitoring tools configured with 10, 100 or 1000 Mbps interfaces.

Operating Specifications:

For superior in-line reliability, the Triple-speed Tap features Link Fault Detect (LFD), which gives
the devices connected to the Tap critical information about link status. If either side of the
bi-directional link fails, the Tap immediately communicates the fault to both devices, reducing
the time required to activate a redundant path.

Mechanical Specifications:

The in-line functionality of the Tap ensures that monitoring tools receive all full-duplex traffic as
if it were in-line, including Layer 1 and Layer 2 errors. Fail-open technology provides
transparent forwarding of all traffic on the link in the event of a Tap power failure.
For extra uptime protection, Net Optics Triple-speed Taps offer redundant power supplies.
Should the primary power source fail, the Tap automatically switches to the backup power
source. All network and monitoring cables necessary for plug-and-play deployment are
included.

Passive, Secure Technology

• Provides passive access at 10/100/1000 Mbps speeds without data stream
interference or introducing a point of failure
• Permanent in-line installation without affecting network performance
• Link Fault Detect prevents undetected link failures
• Passes all full-duplex traffic (including errors) from all layers for comprehensive
troubleshooting
• No IP address is needed for the Tap or monitoring device, enhancing monitoring security
• Redundant power ensures monitoring uptime
