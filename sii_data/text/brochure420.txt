Gathering intelligence through real-time network monitoring i s a key
priority for communications service providers, as law enforcement agencies
and other intelligence gathering institutions the world over demand
selective access as a condition for offering service.
The technology and solutions for accurate, real-time traffic capture,
processing, and analysis are becoming increasingly complex as additional
network protocols and tunnels are added t o support network convergence.
For intercept applications t o continue t o be effective and remain in
compliance with regulatory demands, the monitoring access infrastructure
must also evolve t o meet a dynamic converged global network. This access
infrastructure has traditionally been composed of a collection of standard
network elements such as routers, switches, and muxes that are forced
into performing specialized monitoring tasks they were not designed for.
NetQuest's lnterceptor offers a new solution.

NetQuest's OptiCop lnterceptor is a purpose-built, comprehensive access
solution for intercept applications. It offers selective access t o data traffic
on a variety of packet or TDM service networks ranging from high speed
SONETISDHlEthernet t o low speed T1IE1 and DSO. Using Interceptor,
Ethernet based tools can gain and maintain real-time WAN network
access regardless of the WAN interface's data stream speed or i t s framing
attributes, tributary hierarchy, or protocol transport.

NetQuest lnterceptor

While conventional methods of monitoring access perform some of the functions required for full IP data access, only the
lnterceptor stands on top of the pyramid, where selective access t o any IP or non-IP data at any speed on any transport
technology is possible without prior knowledge of the network provisioning.

T R A D I T I O N A L ACCESS VERSUS INTERCEPTOR ACCESS
BEFORE I N T E R C E P T O R

Figure 1 depicts a traditional monitoring access
configuration where a collection of network elements
and diagnostic equipment from multiple vendors is
assembled t o access a range of services. Managing
these disparate tools quickly becomes a tedious
task. Moreover, configuring and maintaining this
infrastructure is a time-consuming, manual process
due t o sheer number of possible physical and logical
connections on a SONETISDH line. Any one line may
carry one or more high speed and many low speed
tributaries. Each of these traffic streams may be
framed and transported by a number of possible
framing formats and protocols. The information
about the specific stream provisioning is difficult t o
obtain and is often outdated or wrong due t o the
frequent changes in network provisioning and enduser configurations.

AFTER INTERCEPTOR

The lnterceptor is specifically designed for selective
monitoring access. It consolidates the conventional
access functions with advanced auto-discovery and
filtering functions in a single, highly integrated
platform shown in Figure 2. Its ability t o discover and
automatically adjust t o any standard stream speed
and format makes i t s access functions independent
from network re-provisioning. This, in turn, greatly
simplifies the management of the overall system,
specifically if it is integrated with the intercept
application. Further, it can both translate WAN input
traffic t o standard Ethernet output and off-load the
intercept probe's CPU processing requirements by
filtering and pre-processing traffic. These functions
preserve valuable probe resources and enable it t o be
more efficient by processing only the data of interest.

COST SAVINGS REALIZED
The lnterceptor costs significantly less than the sum of the various conventional access products it replaces. Besides
i t s lower acquisition cost and automated discovery process, the lnterceptor delivers the following long term cost of
ownership benefits:
Reduced management costs
Simpler t o install and less cabling
Less rack space and power required
Lower long term maintenance costs

AUTO-DISCOVERY PROCESS
The heart of NetQuest's lnterceptor is i t s ground-breaking Auto-Discovery process. In applications where private line
or virtual private line services are being delivered, bandwidth allocation and protocol usage can vary greatly because
they are determined by the end-user's specific termination equipment. This issue is further complicated by the dynamic
nature of network provisioning, which can change on a daily or even hourly basis. Auto-Discovery eliminates the need
for the test equipment used t o analyze circuit utilization, the ongoing manpower needed t o operate this equipment,
and the subsequent task of re-provisioning traditional solutions.

lnterceptor detects, qualifies, and reports all physical and transmission protocol parameters of all identifiable traffic
streams on SONETISDHIPDH lines. It achieves this by automatically analyzing the clear channel or channelized TDM
digital signal hierarchy of each stream t o determine the signal speed, framing format, and channelization structure. It
also discovers which tributary containers are in use, which tributary streams are aggregated into virtual groups, and
the aggregation scheme (GFPI VCATILCAS and IMA). lnterceptor then determines the data framing protocol being
utilized as, for example, POS, ATM, or HDLC. By further analyzing the framed messages, it also determines the type of
IP transport protocol such as PPP, Frame Relay, MPLS, cHDLC, PPPoE, etc. In the final step of Auto-Discovery, lnterceptor
publishes the results t o be utilized by the intercept application or network operator. The entire process runs continually
in the background t o ensure any changes in usage or service interruptions are detected and critical surveillance is
maintained.

The Auto-Discovery process is shown in the diagram above, along with an example of the table of SONETISDHIPDH
attributes acquired and reported by the Interceptor.

D A T A TARGETING
Using the results of the Auto Discovery process, intercept applications can target specific data of interest for further
processing and in doing so, preserve their own processing resources for higher level tasks. Selected IP streams are
extracted, translated into Ethernet frames, and forwarded t o the intercept application. lnterceptor also effectively
handles non-IP traffic by first attempting t o identify the contents and then publishing the results. Traffic that could not
be processed or identified can be efficiently groomed and redirected t o clear channel or TDM bypass outputs for further
investigation by external systems, ensuring no potentially threatening data is lost.

MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL
The NetQuest lnterceptor can be managed locally or remotely using menu-driven screens via Telnet or a serial crafts
person port. Both methods provide secure access through SSH and a multi-level password protection system that
leverages Radius or TACACS+. The lnterceptor has an integral SNMP V1-V3 agent that supports TRAP functionality for
alarming purposes.
For applications where a tight integration between the lnterceptor and the intercept application system is required,
NetQuest has developed a machine-to-machine interface called GSCP, a proprietary UDP-based control protocol.
Integrating GSCP with the intercept application system enables solution providers t o present a unified solution at every
level.
