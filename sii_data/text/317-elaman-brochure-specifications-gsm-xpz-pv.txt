Active Off-Air System: GSM-XPZ PV

General Overview
The GSM-XPZ family of active interception solutions provide a tactical tool for law enforcement, government and military agencies.
Utilising commercial base-station technology and operating independently of the GSM
network providers, the GSM-XPZ family of vehicle and portable products provide the
capability to clone and simultaneously transmit multiple fake GSM networks to interact with GSM cell phones.
The GSM-WPZ PV can
• Covertly identify the unique identity (IMSI/IMEI) of target GSM cell phones
• Locate known targets using their GSM mobiles in conjunction with the direction
finding equipment
• Take control of target phones for the purpose of denying GSM services
• Intercept outgoing calls and SMS made by a target
• Create a bubble or exclusion zone to deny GSM network coverage without alerting
cell phones
