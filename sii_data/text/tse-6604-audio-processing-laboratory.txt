Audio Processing Laboratory

Model 6604

TSE 6604 takes forensic audio processing and analysis to the next level. Fully integrating
the capabilities of both hardware and software, TSE 6604 seamlessly handles forensic
analysis and processing of all analog and digital media, including file based digital media.
TSE 6604 represents productivity enhancement through a seamlessly integrated audio
workstation environment, capable of blending the merits of superb audio filtering with
comprehensive speech and signal processing.

Key Features:
• Multi-tasking: Productivity-enhancing features such as asynchronous “batchmode”
processing will allow multiple jobs to be handled simultaneously
• Power, Power, Power: The powerful AccelCoreÔ external processor hardware, based on
the Analog Devices TigerSHARCÒ floating-point DSP, provides all audio I/O and performs
lightning fast regardless of workload
• Handles All Media: Common analog and digital media formats, including filebased media,
can be handled directly
• Seamless Integration: Both Direct-X and VST plug-ins will be supported within the AudioLab environment. AudioLab replaces the Master Control Panel found on previous products and allows software-based tools to be mixed and matched with others that are AccelCore-based. Further, the entire setup can be preserved in a single file for easy recall
and repeatability at a later date
• Advanced Visualization: Advanced real-time visualization tools such as Precision Spectrogram, Cepstral Voice Pitch Analyzer, 3D Waterfall Spectral Analyzer, and DTMF/Caller ID
Visualizer will be included
• Additional Software Tools: “Relative” speaker identification, transient reduction, automatic noise/effect analysis, multi-track alignment, and conversion to common lawenforcement audio formats will also be provided
Key Benefits:
• Intuitive design
• Seamless integration
• Powerful digital filters
• Spectrum analysis
• Virtual patching capability
• Maximum flexibility
• File & tape media handling
• ASCLD reporting

Additional Consideration
• Maximum Efficiency: All real-time filters and visualization tools support multiple instances
up to the maximum resource limitations of the PC, the IEEE-1394 “Firewire” interface,
and the AccelCoreÔ
• Building on Experience: Includes all filtering operations of the current-generation TSE
6601 and MCAP products, plus many new real-time filters such as Clipped-Peak Restoration, Multi-band Downward Expander Noise Reduction, Precision Tracking Comb Filter,
and Enhanced 1CH Adaptive and Reference Canceller filters. Simply amazing
• Sophisticated Timeline Management: Tool allows different processing to be applied to
different portions of the recording while maintaining evidence integrity
• Flexible and Intuitive Interface: The redesigned graphical user interface is easy to navigate, allowing for quick filter setup and changes
• More Science - Better Results: Gamma's proven methodology and built-in scientific approach help produce results that win cases and survive legal challenges
