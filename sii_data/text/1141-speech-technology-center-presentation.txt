Professional Real-Time
Noise Cancellation &
Speech Enhancement Software

Sound Cleaner is unique software for filtering of noise-corrupted sound
recordings and improvement of speech intelligibility.
The user can adjust the filtering parameters and hear the changes
made in real-time.
Allows the user to reduce different types of noise from any sound
source, even in cases where the speech is hardly intelligible.

! Signal is processed by a sequence of
modules. There are 14 typical schemes
of processing available.
! It is possible to build customized
schemes.
! All modules work simultaneously in
sequence.

! All options are adjustable in
real-time while listening to
the output.
! Each module is represented
by a separate window with
a number of basic and
professional controls.

Sound Cleaner consists of 19
processing modules including:
! 8192 independent band
graphical equalizer with
automatic and manual
modes.
! 2048 manually adjustable
equalizer sliders which
allow the user to suppress
narrow bands (2.5 Hz) by 72
dB down, it is also possible
to operate sliders by group.

! Adaptive broadband noise
filter cancels the most kinds
of home/office equipment
noise. The broadband
noise is suppressed down
by 10-20 dB.

! Adaptive frequency
compensation filter. 8192
taps allow suppression of
many mixed types of
noise.

! 4 adaptive stereo filters in time
and frequency domain are
effective against distributed
interference (radio, TV,
concert, bar environment) or
point-source noise.

! Adaptive inverse filter
automatically suppresses
narrowband noise - highly
effective against reverberation
and non-stationary hindrances.

! Pulse-like interference filter

! Dynamic processing /
automatic gain control module
successfully deals with the
recordings of speech at
different volume levels

! The user has the ability to see
waveforms and FFT spectrums
of the source signal and of the
processed one.

! Sound Stretcher module for
playback speed adjustment.
Playback speed can be increased
or decreased up to 2-3 times
without voice pitch distortion or
speech quality loss.

! Sound file (*.wav) or real-time
audio stream can be processed.
The files can be listen to and
stored at the same time.
! Advanced playback
functionality: loop, search,
precise pointer setting.

! Volume control and pseudostereo mode sound playback, for
more comfortable listening.

! Amplification range is -60...+60dB.
When the signal level after
processing drops, a higher gain
setting value is useful.

Eliminates different types of noises and distortions:

! Broadband and narrowband noise, stationary and nonstationary noise can be eliminated.
! From such sources as: telephone lines, engine, home/office
appliances, industrial equipment, street, aircraft engine,
power supply, room echo and reverberation.

!

19 processing modules

!

All modules work simultaneously

!

All controls can be adjusted in real time

!

The Sequence of the modules can be edited by user

!

14 pre-defined processing schemes give guidance in
determining what noise is present and how to remove it

Self-adjusting improvement of voice quality and intelligibility
Removal of background noise and interferences
Tonal distortion suppression up to 70 dB
White noise reduction 12-30 dB
Manually adjusted noise reduction characteristics for fine
tuning
! Selectable signal bandwidth
