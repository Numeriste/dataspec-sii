HINTON Mobile
Data Probe

The HINTON Mobile Data Probe is used by telecommunications operators and law
enforcement agencies to provide regulatory enforcement of lawful interception, and by
government agencies involved in the collection of signals intelligence for homeland security
purposes. The data gathered is used to counter terrorism, corruption, and criminal threats
such as drug trafficking.

The HINTON Mobile Data Probe enables the simultaneous monitoring of thousands of
subscriber data access sessions on GSM and UMTS wireless telecommunications networks,
capturing complete subscriber data sessions based on known mobile network identities
and providing intercept handover using standards based interfaces from ETS1/3GPP
Monitoring at the Gn interface interconnect between serving and gateway GPRS support
nodes provides optimal coverage, with optional monitoring of the Gr and C/D interfaces for
improved subscriber identity correlation from MAP signaling carried over SIGTRAN, and the
ability to monitor network interconnects (Gp interface) to offer full coverage as needed.
