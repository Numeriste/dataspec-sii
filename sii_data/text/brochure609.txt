AN/MLQ-40(V)4
Prophet Spiral 1 + Multi-Sensor
SIGINT System
The AN/MLQ-40(V)4 Prophet Spiral 1+ is a ground-based SIGINT
system that provides force protection information in a direct
support role, either stationary or while On-The-Move (OTM). The
system has the capability to detect, monitor, identify and selectively
exploit Radio Frequency (RF) signals for intelligence information
providing situational awareness and potential targets for Tactical
Commanders. The exploited signal data can be relayed via voice or
data through the organic Wideband Beyond Line of Sight (WBLOS)
SATCOM communications system. The system has a networking
capability with other similar assets to coordinate target information
and location, as well as allowing real-time connection to the Global
SIGINT Enterprise. The available AN/PRD-13(V)2 manpack configuration provides additional force protection information.
Modular, Platform-Independent Design
The system is currently mounted on a High Mobility Multi-Purpose
Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV); however, its design facilitates easy
moves to other suitable vehicles. The system design integrates all
necessary mission equipment into two 7U transit cases (one case for
the Sensor and one for the SATCOM) which along with the WBLOS
antenna can be dismounted for flexibility in operations.
Special Sensor Subsystem
The Prophet Spiral 1+ incorporates a Special Sensor Subsystem and
ancillary equipment including antenna, mounts and cabling. The
Special Sensor Antenna Assembly is comprised of a Monitor and
DF Antenna Array that receives, switches and amplifies RF signals
within the 30 MHz to 3000 MHz frequency band. Both the RF and

serial digital signals are connected to the Special Sensor ReceiverProcessor. Other components of the Special Sensor Subsystem
include an Ethernet switch and a server computer containing two
removable hard drives. Control of the Special Sensor equipment is
accomplished through Warrior Machine Interface (WMI) laptop
computers via an Ethernet LAN.
This modularity and flexibility, which allows the Prophet system to
detect and identify a wide variety of traditional and modern signals,
gives the system its capability as an important part of an all source
intelligence effort.
The ability of the system to geographically locate Signals of
Interest (SOIs) provides a much higher level of situational awareness to the Tactical Commander than is available by other means.
Wideband SATCOM On-The-Move
On today’s dynamic battlefield, the ability to stay connected to the
global enterprise is critical. For Prophet Spiral 1+, WBLOS connectivity is provided by the TRM-1000 which is a field-proven, lowcost SATCOM On-the-Move (SOTM) terminal. The TRM-1000 is
specifically designed to utilize the full capabilities of the Wideband
Global SATCOM (WGS) satellites. The major components of the
TRM-1000 are the MPM-1000 Internet Protocol (IP) modem with
its embedded Network Centric Waveform (NCW) and an FSS-4000
series OTM antenna. The NCW employs native Ethernet encapsulation, which makes it easy to configure military networks that
require COMSEC, TCP accelerators and any other IP networking
devices.
