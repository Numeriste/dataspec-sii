Cell-BlockTM
Prison Jamming System
Preventing the use of mobile phones and
communications devices in Prisons and Secure
Facilities is an important part of security and
crime prevention.
Digital RF can provide, install and maintain 'Cellblock™', a comprehensive communications
device monitoring and jamming system.

Ce/I-block™ can be easily installed and is
tamper proof. Operating over many frequency
bands cell phones, satellite phones, WiFi and
many other communications devices are
disabled.
Working with Ce/1-Gabber a prison or building
can be jammed but still allow certain mobile
phones to work normally.

The Cell-block™ jammer system is designed and manufactured in the UK. The
equipment is suitable for fitting into Prisons I Jails or secure buildings to give protection
against unauthorised use of mobile phones and other mobile communications devices.
The jammers are wall mounted or free standing with universal power supply.
A full range of efficient antennas are provided in the system to ensure the maximum
energy is transmitted into the required area. These antenna are designed and built by
Digital RF and can be provided or installed as part of a turnkey solution. An optional
battery backup facility can also be offered to provide one hour of use without power from
the mains.
A wide selection of frequency bands are available depending on country and local
operator networks. Each jammer is fully remote controlled by the Digital RF 'RF Centrl'
monitor and control software application. Activity logs of all events are stored on the RF
Centrl central control computer for analysis.
Cell-block is design for 24hr use 365 days a year in harsh environments. It is virtually
maintenance free and easily operated by non technical staff.
