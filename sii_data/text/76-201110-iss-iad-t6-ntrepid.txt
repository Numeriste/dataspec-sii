Best Practices to Protect Yourself
1. Think before you type. Your brain
is your best security tool.

7. Do not conduct any personal
business on operational
computers.

2. Use a different email address for
every website and for each
activity.

8. Work in a virtualized environment,
and revert to a baseline image
frequently.

3. Use unique usernames and
passwords for every site and for
each activity.

9. Never keep sensitive or work
information on the machine (or
Virtual Machine Image) used for
Internet operations/investigations.

4. Clear private data and history
from your browsers after every
session.

10. Make sure your Internet activities
can never be traced back to you
or your organization.

5. Use and maintain firewall and
anti-malware tools.
6. When engaged in Web
harvesting, use a large number of
source IP addresses.
