Small form real-time wireless surveillance streaming

, je,

The Wl S400 real-time wireless video streaming encoder provides high-quality
video/audio in a low-power, secure, discreet and easy t o deploy unit.
With an ultra small form factor and two built-in GPRS/3G/HSDPA modules, the
S400 represents the next generation in tactical video intelligence.
Not all wireless vldeo solutions are created equal
TV1 wireless encoders are a world-class surveillance
solution for secure remote viewing of video over very low
bandwidth networks. In comparison to other wireless
video technologies, such as MPEG compression, TV1
provides a higher quality, lower latency and more resilient
approach t o real-time video and audio transmission.
MPEG and H.264 solutions rely on standard compression
techniques that can result in reduced frame rates, frame
skipping and difference coding. In contrast, by combining
a proprietary codec with an adaptive and more efficient
approach t o managing the underlying communications
channel, TV1 is able t o maintain a fixed frame rate and
deliver lower latency video over constrained bandwidths.

Key features
Ultra lightweight, compact enclosure with no moving
parts for reliable, resilient and silent operation
Secure live video and audio (two way) transmission
over very low bandwidth (supports 9Kbps to 1Mbps)
Rapidly deployable (in minutes) for operational
situations where installation time is critical
Constructed to accommodate the high level of
vibration associated with vehicle deployment
Features two integrated GPRS/3G/HSDPA modules
(with SIM carriers) for reliable networking
Changes t o codec settings or software upgrades can
be delivered remotely over the air
10/100 RJ45 Ethernet connector for ADSL and
network lines and satellite connectivity

Practical operational benefits
TV1 ensures a more efficient representation of detail at
lower bandwidths, particularly where motion levels are
high, as well as exceptionally low latency in the remote
control of cameras. Error resilience is also particularly
high, since the TVl codec is more tolerant of packet loss.
With secure AES 256 encryption, an ultra compact form
factor, low power consumption (5.5 watts nominal to 1.5
watts in standby mode and 0.1 in sleep mode) and the
flexibility to operate over GPRS, 3G and satellite networks,
as well as tactical IP radios and the internet, TV1 can be
rapidly deployed into a range of environments and
situations. The S400 includes two built-in GPRS/3G/HSDPA
modules for reliable networking and is network agnostic.

Operational dornalns and Installed base
TV1 codecs are deployed by organisations in the law
enforcement, military and transportation domains, as well
as by those responsible for securing public spaces. I t s ultra
compact form factor and simple installation make it ideal
for a range of static and dynamic operating scenarios:
Covert surveillance operations (video and/or audio)
Body-worn surveillance
Rapid deployment tactical surveillance

Multiple operators are able to view live streaming video
and the unit also supports retrieval of high resolution
images with simultaneous streaming of video, providing
access to frames of particular interest.
