Key Reasons To Develop DPI Capabilities Externally
Answers to the survey question: “Please rate the importance of the following
reasons to develop DPI capacities externally”
Faster time to market
Access to continuous protocol and
application updates
Focus internal resources on core
solutions business instead of DPI
Leveraging specialized expertise, such
as reverse engineering protocols
Product scability to high network
speeds (n x 10 Gbit/s)

Proliferation of new
applications (e.g. video, social
networking, P2P)

Need to handle regional
protocols

Developing & Maintaining DPI and NI Capabilities Internally
Takes Time & Energy
Non standard protocols & applications
Growing number + constant evolution!

Is it your core business to keep
up with constantly evolving
protocols and applications??

Challenges for an Organization
Get the expertise on existing protocols and applications (today)
find the specific skills
Experts in protocol reverse engineering
Experts in many-core processors development
Experts in protocol testing

Keep talents in the organization
Frequent workload peaks
Project without an end (constant updates)
Need to maintain a high level of productivity and quality

Develop an ecosystem
To get traffic trace from all parts of the world
To have access to protocol specifications

DPI Software Must Cope with Increasing Throughputs
Recommending optimal solution
architecture to focus DPI only on
relevant flows: video off-load, smart
packet processing, NICs, etc.
Leveraging many-core processor
technology: Intel, NUMA, DPDK,
Tilera Gx100, etc.
Optimizing DPI software code to
take advantage of hardware
capabilities

DPI is CPU-intensive
