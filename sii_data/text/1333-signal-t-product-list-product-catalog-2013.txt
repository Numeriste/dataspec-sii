PURPOSE
Multifunctionaldetection devices ST 131 PIRANHA-II and ST131N are intended for detecting and localization of eavesdropping devices as well as identification of natural and artificial sources of information leakage.
ST131N has additional option of NON LINEAR JUNCTION DETECTOR IN WIRE LINE.
The main types of the STM, for detection of which 51131 18designed are following.
The STM with transmission of informationby radio channel:
Radio microphones lnclud~ng
dev~ces
w~thstorage and subsequent transfer of information [so called " burst transmitter") and
Frequency Hopp~ngSpread Spectrum (FHSS),
Telephone transrn~tters,rad~ostethoscopes, and wireless video cameras,
Mobile phones and modems of CDMA,
authorizat~on,
B

CSM,UMTS, DECT, WLAN and BLUETOOTH standards used without

Radio beacons for object movement tracI<lng

The STM that use AC power, telephone, N
,security and fire alarm lines for informationtransfer.
The STM transmitting information in optical
infrared range and ultrasonic frequency
range.
