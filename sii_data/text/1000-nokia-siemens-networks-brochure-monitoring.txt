Monitoring Center
Keep your eyes open

“Keep your eyes open” is not only the imperative duty
of law enforcement agencies worldwide – it is everyday
reality in the Monitoring Center.
What can better represent the very essence of our
intelligence solutions than the peerless black panther?
Constantly alert, his vigilant eye misses nothing. That is
why we have chosen the panther’s eye as the symbol
for our Monitoring Center.

One solution for all networks,
vendors and technologies.
The	
    Monitoring	
    Center	
    has	
    been	
    speciﬁcally	
    
developed to service the complex monitoring
needs of law enforcement agencies worldwide.
It is a remarkably versatile combination of
interoperating software and hardware modules
and is designed to perform all tasks related
to lawful interception in an absolutely secure,
auditable,	
    reliable	
    and	
    veriﬁable	
    manner	
    in	
    
accordance with ETSI LI standards. Its unique
modular Front-End and Back-End architecture
allows the monitoring and interception of all
types of voice and data communication in all
networks,	
    i.e.	
    ﬁxed,	
    mobile,	
    Next	
    Generation	
    
Network	
    (NGN)	
    and	
    the	
    internet.	
    

Despite its complexity, the Monitoring Center’s
modular	
    design	
    is	
    extremely	
    ﬂexible	
    –	
    allowing	
    
for customized solutions, scalable in size and
capacity. It has been designed to address all
networks and monitoring requirements. Our
customers can choose from a wide range of
add-on applications to access already available
information and provide additional intelligence.
The	
    Monitoring	
    Center’s	
    uniﬁed	
    view-­concept	
    
greatly facilitates investigative work and opens
completely	
    new	
    and	
    efﬁcient	
    ways	
    to	
    pursue	
    
leads.

Intelligence Platform
Trace the track… to stay ahead

The black panther is characterized by its
remarkable elegance of movement and
outstanding intelligence. Its position at the
top of the food chain is undisputed. Its nose
is so sensitive that it can trace even the
faintest track. That is why we have chosen
the panther’s nose as the symbol for our
Intelligence Platform.

Today, the greatest challenge which law
enforcement agencies have to face worldwide
is not data collection, but data analysis. It is not
a matter of obtaining and accessing authentic
data, but of putting information in context and
transforming it into intelligence.
Intelligence is the synergetic product of connecting
the dots and providing meaningful and trustworthy
information to decision-makers about the
changing nature of threats.
Our Intelligence Platform is a comprehensive and
ﬂexible	
    intelligence	
    analysis	
    solution.	
    It	
    dissects	
    
huge	
    amounts	
    of	
    data	
    and	
    ﬁnds	
    hidden	
    clues	
    in	
    
seemingly meaningless snippets of information.
It creates new intelligence by using sophisticated
intelligence applications and extensive automation
to process mass data.
The basic principle of the Intelligence Platform
is very simple: It offers one platform and one
desktop for all functions. However, the modular,
scalable design allows for a high degree of
customization by which all features can be
conﬁgured	
    to	
    meet	
    customer	
    requirements.	
    
Optional intelligence modules can be added
separately on request.

6

The Intelligence Platform provides intelligence
which results from the collection, processing,
integration, analysis, evaluation and correlation
of available data, thereby supporting the entire
intelligence cycle.
It is the smart analytical tool for intelligence
personnel and analysts, enabling them to trace
the	
    track	
    and	
    helping	
    decision-­makers	
    to	
    fulﬁll	
    
their mandates: To identify and predict trends,
patterns or problem areas that require action.
Its outstanding features enable them to react on
a level totally unmatched in today’s and
tomorrow’s world of preemptive security.
The Nokia Siemens Networks Intelligence
Platform sets new standards in intelligence.
It offers innovative tailored solutions which are
characterized by operational agility independent
of time and place. It has been designed to meet all
law-enforcement and governmental requirements
and standards – to trace the track and stay ahead.

Our Vision
With insight and ingenuity we will continue
to break new ground and lead the way for
innovative intelligence solutions. We are
convinced that our expertise will enhance
peace and thereby contribute to the
quality of peoples’ lives.
Our Commitment
We deliver evolutionary security solutions
by combining best-of-class products,
state-of-the-art technologies, services
and creativity, thus generating sustainable
customer	
    beneﬁts.	
    
Our Core Values
We are guided by customer-centered
principles. These are based on mutual
trust, reliability and stability.
Our Credo
It is idle merely to philosophize about
warnings like “Without security, there is
no freedom”. Good governance acts upon
them and takes appropriate measures
to make the world a safer place for
individuals, families and nations.

We believe that this is where true
freedom begins.
Our Mission
We are making the world safer with
trendsetting intelligence solutions.

We are pioneers, constantly pushing boundaries to break
new ground for innovative solutions.
We are passionate, employing all our talent and energy to help our customers
fulﬁll	
    their	
    mandates.
We are pragmatic, determined to make sure that our solutions always
meet our customers’ needs.
