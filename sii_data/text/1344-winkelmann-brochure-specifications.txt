Technical Specifications

The SOM(4) system comprises of an
advanced fiber optic microphone
& single-channel electro-optic unit
(EOU200), for digital-to-analog
conversion of optical microphone
output signals.The Single Channel
EOU200 with enhanced electronics box.
It features two analog outputs (one
with volume control for headphones,
another with fixed gain for monitoring
equipment); one pair of ST-style fiber
optic connectors; two 3.5mm sockets
(one for analog output, another for
headphones); greenlred LED voltage
indicator. DSP model (EOU250) provides
up to 22dB of real-timeambient noise
removal (three levels: low, mid, high).
Unit is powered either by internal
battery or external DC power supply.
The SOM(4) is supplied as standard
with clear lmm PVC fiber-optic cable.
Where there is no benefit in the thin,
transparent lmm PVC cable, we
recommend the more robust Kevlar
reinforced black 3mm PVC cable.
The SOM(4) also has option of front
or side extension tube. Extension tube
versions for concealment and better
installation through walls and objects.
The only effect is that it slightly decrease
bandwidthto be around voice frequencies.

Technology
It's built around a tiny MEMS membrane
and two optical fibers. When acoustic
waves impinge on the membrane
they cause it to vibrate, changing the
intensity of light that is reflected from
incoming to outgoing fibers.This
patented mechanism detects even
the slightest changes in membrane
displacement, with resolutions at a
fraction of an Angstrom. Such precision
translates to clear sound and low
self-noise, and produces exceptional
microphone performance. N
