MONITORING CENTERFOR LAWFUL INTERCEPTION
Gamma Group international is a reputable monitoring system integrator for GSM/3G networks. Our
Monitoring Center (MC) is a system designed to enable Law EnforcementAgencies (LEA) and government
agencies to perform Lawful Interception (LI) monitoring in an auditable, secure and reliable manner.
It handles intercepts of voice and data in fixed and mobile networks, on the Internet or other IP networks.
Within the two general forms of intercept, voice and data, it manages a wide range of communication
methods.
The system installations can vary in size from a few computers to an extensive system of many recorders,
data collectors, system servers and clients, depending on the application. Its complexity ranges from
simple passive connection, to a single trunk line, to being responsible for monitoring an entire country's
fixed, mobile, NGN and internet networks.
Sophisticated user-rights and access control mechanisms have been designed to meet the organizational
needs of Law Enforcement and Government Agencies.
The implementation is not rigid and these mechanisms can be used to suit most organizational structures
and variations within the ETSI standards.The mechanisms also build upon the MS Windows environment
to offer a secure but flexible application.
The system performs these monitoring and management tasks from a scalable, distributable and reliable
platform with facilities to ensure the security of the system and intercepted data. Its architecture is
modular, which allows systems to be built and scaled as appropriate to the customer's needs.
The Monitoring Center supports a wide-range of fixed and mobile switches, Internet ISP and backbone
interception points, NGN networks and mobile IP It can decode fax and local loop internet from circuit
switched networks and all popular Internet protocols from IP networks.
Through add-on product interfaces, the MC offers its data for further analysis and intelligence extraction.
It is currently in use in more than 60 countries.

IPMONITORING
FinLI is a Front-End system to capture IP data from IP networks according to the requirements of Lawful
Interception (LI) or Intelligence Monitoring (IM). It provides the captured IP data to the Law Enforcement
Monitoring Facilities (LEMF)—Monitoring Center according to several international standards like ETSI
and CALEA (and some other formats).
The IP Probe components are based on high-end standard server technology and are deployed in the IP
network (ISP network) using passive tapping devices to ensure working with a 100% copy of the complete
IP traffic without interfering with the network i t s e l f
operators.
By using a wide range of sophisticated filtering methods, realized with Deep Packet Inspection, FinLI
can provide the target and/or application data needed. LI implements many differentTarget Identification
procedures, like RADIUS dialog sniffing or active communication with the AM-Servers in the access
network to identify the targets of interest currently active in the network.
For Intelligence Monitoring, which is nottarget based, but related to Application Monitoring (e.g. identifying
and recording of Webmail traffic or specific files transferred via the Internet), theTarget Identification is not
an issue. In this case, the IP Probes will inspect the traffic bit by bit to identify applications and files and
then will provide the data, in addition to the source and destination addresses, to the Monitoring Center for
storage, archiving and evaluation.

nter for

Lawful Interception (LI) is the legally approved
surveillance o f telecommunication services,
and has become a n important tool for law
enforcement agencies (LEAs) around the world for
investigating and prosecuting criminal activities
and terrorism. Most countries have passed laws
that require telecommunication service providers
to support LEAs with duly authorized requests to
identify, monitor, and deliver all of the electronic
communications o f specified individuals and
groups. While regulations and requirements
vary from country to country, international and
US American standardization bodies like ETSI
or ANSI have developed technical standards for
LI that will facilitate the work of LEAs and help
operators and service providers to minimize their
costs. Although various standards for LI use
different terminology, the basic functional model
shown in figure 1 applies to all LI standards and
to all network and service types.

The main functions of any LI solution are to
access Interception-Related Information (IRI)
and Content of Communication (CC) from the
telecommunications network and to deliver the
information in a standardized format via the
handover interface to one or more monitoring
centers of law enforcement agencies. Of course,
before surveillance can take place, interception
requests must be approved and appropriately
provisioned to the Interception Access Points
within the service provider's network, and they
must be carefully and accurately terminated after
the interception authorization expires. In addition,
high security requirements for LI systems are
essential to prevent possible manipulation and
misuse.

DATARETENTION SYSTEM
Data Retention System refers to the process of storing call detail records and subscriber data for various
telecommunication services for a period of several months and years. Law enforcement agencies and
intelligence services regard the access to retained telecom data as an important pillar of criminal
investigation and the prevention of terrorism. The common objective is to use the data to identify and
trace suspects, uncover social networks among terrorists, or to collect admissible evidence for court
proceedings.

A-Interface and a number of SS7 links at the same time.The A-Interface solution assumes thatTMSts
are also unique within the context of a Location Area Code (LAC) and that the LACs are unique with
the context of the PLMN identity. In cases where TMSIs are not unique, different name spaces can be
configured. It may not be necessary to monitor all links between an MSC and its sub-tended BSCs.

WIRELESSLOCATORSYSTEM (WLS) FOR GSM /NTS NETWORKS
WLS is the only technology that provides high-accuracy mobile location, across all types of environments,
in a highly scalable and cost-effective way. The easy-to-deploy, easy-to-manage solution provides LI
applications with the precise location of mobile devices to accuracy within 50 meters, and gives Law
Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) real-time, post-event, geo-fenced and even predictive intelligence using
mass Location capabilities.
The Wireless Locator has the following applications:

Target-based Location Interception
Adding high-accuracy location information t o
target-based interception allows LEAs to monitor
fleeing suspects in real time and track a historical
"bread-crumb trail" of the wireless activity of a
specific user. The highly-accurate WLS solution
can pinpoint the location of mobile devices to the
exact building.

Mass Location Interception
WLS is the only location technology that enables
accurate mass location of all devices on a mobile
network. Mass location is especially helpful for
post-event analytics based on historical archived
data, identifying all wireless activity in an area
over a set period of time.This gives LEAs critical
investigative information about suspects after an
event - such as a bomb going off including who
was present, who they were talking to and what
they did in the immediate aftermath.

•
N I S M I M I l l % 11 6

Border-zone Location Interception
Border-zone location interception allows a n
electronic virtual fence to be set up around a high
security area or an international border, allowing
LEAs to track the location of wireless devices that
travel in and out of the area. The accuracy of the
WLS solution ensures that precise locations are
identified along the border zone, preventing even
marginal incursions.

3GN IMSI CATCHER
36 Blind Call is a new software feature for the
36N UNITS system. It allows 36 phones to be
locked to the 3GN and placed in a UMTS blind/
silent call for tracking purposes. This is the only
way to establish blind calls to phones that are set
in "36 only" mode, and it removes the reliance on
passing the 36 phone to a GSM systemfor tracking
—the target phone stays on 3G frequencies at all
times.The 36-OF can detect and track the signal
from a 36 phone in a blind call, allowing the OF
operator to locate it.
Blind Call Features:
• N e w Acquisition mode for the 36N and OF target status for 36 phones makes operation simple
• Multiple 36 blind calls can be supported by each 36N Node B
• Automatic 36 power control ensures that Node B and phoneTX power are continually adjusted to
optimal levels to maintain the blind call
• T h e 36N can continue to take registrations from other 36 phones whilst maintaining a blind call to
the target phone
3G Direction Finder Features:
• Provides indication of target RSCP (Received Signal Code Power) to enable operator to judge
distance and bearing to target
• Features graphical and audio feedback of current target RSCP level for ease of use in challenging
operational scenarios
• Quick and simple to use with minimal configuration required

The 3GN captures the 3G phone
and places it into a blind call.
The uplink and
powers are automatically
adjusted to optimise the
connection to the phone.

XPZWIRELESS IP
The XPZ is normally controlled by a Cat 5 cable that connects the laptop to the XPZ.
We can provide you our secure wireless IP connection instead of the cable connection enabling remote
controlling of the XPZ from a safe remote location.
This is possible in different ways:
IV units
• F o u r channels enabling four links to operate in the same area
• Secure wireless Link
• Output power of 100mW
• Simple to deploy and contain a battery (typically last for 2 hours)
• Range extensions by deploying additional units
High Powered Wi Fi units
• Longer range
• H i g h output 10-20W
• Incorporate 36 Router
COFDM MESH units
• Diversity reception to greatly enhance the range and copes better with multi path conditions
• MESH Network could be linked to www by secure 36 routerNPN or satellite connection

The RF unit can be used on four channels
enabling if necessary four links to operate
in the same area.
The Cat 5 cable can be replaced by a secure
wireless link. The RF units only have an
output power of 100mW so the range is
limited but may be more than adequate in
some operational scenarios. Naturally, the
range can be extended with the use of the
appropriate aerials and choice of frequency
band. The units are very simple to deploy and
contain a battery which would typically last
for two hours.

SURVEILLANCEVEHICES
The Remote Video Surveillance Vehicle System
is designed to allow covert video and audio
surveillance of a target area without detection,
allowing greater flexibility during surveillance
operations.
The system allows the operator to park the
vehicle close to the target's location, house,
office, restaurant, etc. and transmit the gathered
information back to the command location in a
surveillance van, observation point or another
support vehicle.
It allows the operational surveillance team to
monitor by video, for example, the images of the
target location from the four cameras concealed
within the vehicle.
It allows the surveillance team to monitor audio
transmissions from the target location from room
or body-worn equipment, and activate hidden
microphones linked to the Remote Case.
It also allows the operational surveillance team
to connect external video and audio equipment
to allow long range observation of a target in a
difficult environment or remote location.
tXmomile,

Control of the system is by a digital telemetry link,
which allows full control of the camera selection,
pan, tilt, zoom functions, a s well a s repeat
incoming video and audio signals from the room
or body-worn systems used by the undercover
surveillance team.

Riorsgame COW

These remote systems are usually fitted into
vehicles (saloon cars, 4x4s) that can then
be left unattended i n the surveillance area,
transmitting the intelligence information required
to the Command Surveillance Vehicle COFDM/IP
MESH/3G.
Using our unique Motorbike Remote System, as
part of the total surveillance operation, allows
even greater flexibility in the covert surveillance
operation. The Motorbike Remote System allows
the surveillance team t o link several video/
audio remote systems into the total surveillance
concept.

The Model 5030 is an extremely light weight and
quite flying surveillance platform. Due to the
electronic position control the AirRobot can be
flown without any pilot experience. The flying
surveillance platform can be in the air manually
controlled or is fully programmable. If it receives no
commands, it remains at its height and direction,
GPS or optical position system (UPS) controlled.
This allows the pilot to concentrate fully on his
surveillance mission. Different Cameras for video
surveillance operations are available (Daylight
colour sensor, night vision, digital andTherrnal).

ADVANCED LONGJOHN SYSTEM
Designed specifically f o r professional
surveillance, Model 5122 uses the latest series
of ultra low light (0.00003 lux) with 'Night Mode'
cameras to produce unbeatable images in day
and night conditions.The flexible 6 to 100 x optical
zoom and pan and tilt system allows targets to
be monitored a t long distances and tracked
using the proportional pan, tilt and zoom system.
Deployable in minutes and powered by battery or
mains, this rapid deployment system is a powerful
tool for any serious surveillance operation.

HIGHPERFORMANCE
MINIATURE THERMAL CAMERA
The Model 5214 u n i t is a high-performance,
miniature thermal imager for real-time imagery
in the 7-14 m spectral range (Long-Wave InfraRed, LWIR).This extremely small and lightweight
camera delivers images of outstanding quality,
at very low power consumption.The unit can be
used for both standalone applications and for
integrated multi-sensor systems.

p .

INFINITY LENS
The Model 5215 Infinity Lenses are the only
lenses in the world that stay in focus throughout
the entire image. Conventional lenses have a
limited depth of field, which means they can only
focus on either the foreground or the background
of an image at one time - never both.The Infinity
Lens defies this tradition. Employing revolutionary
optics technology that can focus on objects both
in the foreground and background, the Infinity
Lens offers massive depth of field (MDF) meaning
the foreground and background of a shot are in
focus simultaneously.

forensic data recovery

Forensic data recovery is not to be confused
with standard data recovery. Data recovery is
the art of retrieving data from a source that is
not easily obtainable, (mainly hard disk drives,
memory cards, tapes, RAID systems etc), however,
Forensic data recovery is different. In standard
data recovery, the original data source, (e.g. the
dead hard drive) is rebuilt, (if required), then an
'image' is taken, at which point the data recovery
technician re-works the data so that it is useable
to the client.
Computer Forensics is the function of utilising
scientifically proven methods t o assemble
together and process data found on a digital
device, (computer, hard disk drive, mobile phone,
memory card etc), and interpret that data for
possible use in a court of law or other theatre
of investigation. The evidence may assist in the
prosecution or a criminal, help in the defense of
an accused person, or be of intelligence to an
individual who is seeking knowledge for either
personal or professional reasons.
Mobile phones are consistently used during
many forms of criminal activity, and by performing
mobile phone forensics on the cellular network
usage of a particular mobile phone it is possible to
trace where and when calls were made from.This
is particularly useful in stalking type cases, where
a mobile phone has been used to harass another
individual. A mobile phone forensics firm will be
able to trace and quantify phone uses within the
cellular network.

VIPCONVOY JAMMERS
The Model 3260-S has been upgraded to cover
the 20 to 6000 MHz frequency range. Electronic
Counter Measures (ECM) or Jamming Systems
provide protection for VIP dignitaries against
attacks by radio control. Nobody knows when,
where or on which frequency such attacks may
occur, therefore, VIP protection must be at a very
high sophisticated level. As an optional upgrade
we also offer our Hybrid Jammer with free
programmable frequencies between 20 to 500
MHz.

PORTABLEBRIEFCASE GSM/UMTS
The Model 3530-1 Portable Covert GSM Jamming
System i s a 4 Band Jammer covering t h e
frequencies most commonly used by GSM and
36 Cellular Systems. It is designed to be effective
within a 25 Meter range within the target area as
shown below. The system is unique in that it does
not require any ventilation, making the unit silent
and also covert. As the system does not require
ventilation, in can be operated with the case
fully closed. This means that it can be placed in
a located, be effective and not draw any undue
attention.
