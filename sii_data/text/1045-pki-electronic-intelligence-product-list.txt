PKI MOBILE JAMMING SYSTEMS VEHICLE MOUNTED
Modular Design
The PKI modular jamming system can be scaled and adapted to any necessary application. Depending on available space
and power, country of destination and customer specification PKI adapts the electronics and antennas to match given
specifications.
Full Range Jamming
Frequencies can be covered from 20MHz up to 6000MHz using high sophisticated sweep generators which are capable
of interfering analogue and digital transmissions. Depending on the requested power the number of incorporated units
may vary.
Intensified Bands
Based on our experience on available remote controls of cell phones and other devices we incorporate additional units to
improve the covered distance for well known frequency ranges.
Sweeping Technology
PKI „High Speed Sweeper“ show how precise the power amplifier are modulated. This avoids unnecessary technical side
effects which could endanger the mission.
Power Supply
The high power modules of the HF-modules can be either powered by:
•Vehicle engine alternator
•Independent Generator
•Mains operation
For high power systems vehicle engine alternator, also improved versions (< 2 KW), might not be sufficient to source a
system. Therefore we offer a build-in high power generator solution.
Cooling
Depending on the given environment of the country of operation, we offer separate cooling solutions for the electronics
and driver compartment.
Antennas
All antennas are specially designed to the specific frequencies to broadcast.
We offer two options for the antennas:
•directional antennas, because they are much more effective to produce a „clean“ corridor along the convoy
•omni-directional antennas
Shielding
All high power jamming systems are equipped with special protection mechanism to avoid health damages to the driver
and the operators. Even though the output power is in the official limits, we protect the car with special window foil to
block any high frequency power from the antenna going inside the car. The complete car will be shielded like a Faraday
cage.
Control and Monitoring
All controls will be placed in the driver´s compartment. The system is to operate, just by one button. For trained
personnel it is possible to monitor all system parameters, function, temperatures and video surveillance from the
operator seat.

Production and Development

The operator of the Jamming System gets an immediate warning if one of the components fails. He can easily see the
location of the problem.
Vehicles
The optimum vehicles for mobile jamming systems vary due to power requirements. We are capable to adapt the
electronics to most cars offering enough space. Ideally it is installed in long version vans or pick-up trucks. As option
armoured cars or 4x4 vehicles can be equipped.
Vehicle Selection Criteria
•Top Speed
•Armoured
•Available Service in Country
•Size and appearance
•Emergency functions
Communication
For higher security we do not recommend communication between the vehicles. Every communication gap can be used
to compromise the system. Usually, clients use acoustic or optical methods to communicate with running jammer
systems. All cars can be equipped with PA systems, sirens, special horns and emergency lights. If requested, the end
user can specify frequencies for communication.
Video Surveillance
The vehicles can be equipped with every kind of video surveillance for front, back or all-round view with regular cameras,
day-night or thermal imaging systems.
Different models of recording devices can be selected for long recording periods.

PKI 6600

Jammer for Mains Circuits
Most of the time a room monitoring attack is
carried out by more or less smart RF bugs, in
some cases even equipped with remote control
to prevent quick and easy detection by counter
surveillance scanners. But less sophisticated and
low cost solutions like Intercom systems for the
communication through the main lines most
often are not taken into consideration. Such
systems simply can be bought in normal stores,
and by removing the housings, the basic
components are small enough to be hidden in
places of mains power distribution sockets or
junctions. Therefore the risk of this kind of attack
is enormous. The PKI 6600 as a jammer system
for mains protects sensitive areas against room
eavesdropping through the mains line. PKI 6600
simply has to be plugged into the mains socket
and is running fully automatic and disturbs the
signal with an AM/FM-modulated noise. Direct
listening to the target transmission is possible
via headphone.

PKI 6650

Mobile Jamming Systems
The PKI 6650 uses the technology of the more
advanced digital frequency generation, compared
to the traditional PLL technique, in order to allow
different modes of signal generation.
A) Spot-jamming of a particular frequency or
channel
B) Hopping - Jamming of jumping frequencies in
combination with an optional connected
surveillance receiver, a single bus-band may be
selected or the whole spectrum of 20-3000 MHz.
On special request we are able to deliver also
frequencies up to 6 GHz.
C) Sweep - Jamming of a frequency band at an
ultra-fast speed and in a continuous mode,
various programmable frequency windows allow
to define the beginning and end of the frequency
bands to cover.
D) Barriage - Instantaneous and continuous p.n.
noise (pseudo noise) jamming over a wide band.
It is possible to activate all sub-bands at the
same time and to get a total complete RMS
power of 1100 W output to the antenna.

Production and Development

PKI 6660

Car Lock Jammer
This jammer is designed for the use in situations
where it is necessary to inspect a parked car.
Whenever a car is parked and the driver uses the
car key in order to lock the doors by remote
control, normally he does not check afterwards if
the doors are really locked or not. For such a
case you can use the PKI 6660. It can be placed
in car-parks, both outdoors and in car-park
buildings. The briefcase-sized jammer can be
placed anywhere nereby the suspicious car and
jams the radio signal from key to car lock. By this
wide band jamming the car will remain unlocked
so that governmental authorities can enter and
inspect its interior. The complete system is
integrated in a standard briefcase. Optionally it
can be supplied with a socket for an external
antenna, so that PKI 6660 can even be placed
inside a car, parked in the same area, with the
antenna placed on top of the car. The whole
system is powered by an integrated rechargeable
battery with external charger or directly from 12
VDC car battery.
Specifications:
• Dimensions: standard briefcase approx. 50 x 40 x 20 cm
• Weight: approx. 5 kg

• Jamming of a particular
frequency or channel
• Modular system based on 19" racks
• Hopping of jumping frequencies
• Sweeping of a frequency band at
ultra-high speed

• Output frequency: to cover all radio frequencies
for remote-controlled car locks
• Output antenna: integrated inside the briefcase,
optionally external antenna if jammer is
positioned inside a car

PKI 6670

Remote Control Duplicator
Often the door of an observed car has to be
opened without leaving any damages or traces.
This is quite difficult sometimes! Our remote
control duplicator enables you to open any car
door easily. When a driver opens his car with a
remote control, an encrypted signal will be sent
to the car which opens the door. This signal will
be captured by our duplicator and decrypted.
With the obtained data a new remote control will
be programmed with which it’s very easy to open
the door of the relevant car without leaving any
trace.

Specifications:
• Dimensions:
140 x 190 x 30 mm
• Weight:
240 g
• Power supply:
12 V battery
• Display:
LED frequency counter
Comes with connecting cable and charger.

PKI 6680

GPS Pocket Jammer
There is a counter device for nearly every tapping
unit. One of these is our PKI 6680. Small, lightweight, but very effective it jams GPS-signals.
This pocket jammer is used if you suspect your
vehicle being equipped with a GPS tracking
system. The pocket jammer sends a spurious
signal on the L1/L2 frequency and eliminates the
GPS tracking signal.
Now you can be certain that a location of your car
is impossible. Other frequencies, i.e. for mobile
phone, radio etc. will not be disturbed.

Specifications:
• Frequency: L1/L2
• Battery capacity: 400 mAh Lion battery
• Operation time: 6 hours
• Charging time: 1,5 hours
• Block distance: radius 5-10 m
• Working currency: 65 mA
• Transmission: built-in antenna
