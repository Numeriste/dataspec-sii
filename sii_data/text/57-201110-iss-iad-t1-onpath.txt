Lawful Intercept: From the Past to the Present
• 25 years ago…

So what does this have to do with Lawful Intercept?

Lawful Intercept from the Past to the Present,
cont.
• Although most communications still start and end with a
copper wire, gone are the days of a simple wire tap
• With the Internet’s relentless growth, trying to isolate
“traffic of interest” is like playing with Russian Dolls…
•

It’s Cartman! No it’s Kyle! No it’s Stan! It has to be Kenny!
Wait…no, it actually came from Mr. Hankey the Christmas Poo!

Challenges for Lawful Intercept and Monitoring
• Sheer volume of data to sort through is mind-boggling
•

How do I efficiently sort through it to find what I need without
causing issues on the network?
–
–

When possible, use high-density, physical layer switches to share expensive
resources (monitoring, aggregation, and filtering equipment)
Passively offload traffic from the network using copper/fiber taps
»

»

•

How do I distribute the “traffic of interest” when and where it is
needed?
–
–

•

Better than SPAN ports or designated Lawful Intercept interfaces of L2/3 equipment
Undetectable to target

Isolate traffic from the production network using physical layer, simplex
switching
Distribute the traffic to the appropriate aggregation, filtering, and switching
equipment

As the Internet continues to grow, how do I scale the network?
