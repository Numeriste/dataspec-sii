developed f o r t h e demodulation a n d
decoding o f facsimile sessions that have
been recorded by professional monitoring
equipment. This software processes data
that has been collected by either a digital
El stream or an analogue line.
The Komcept FADE software outputs
restored image files of transmitted facsimile
pages (BMP or 3PEG files). These files can
be v i e w e d u s i n g standard Microsoft
Internet Explorer, Microsoft Paint, Imaging
for Microsoft and other applications.
The Komcept MADE software suite i s a
solution t o demodulate a n d d e c o d e
information that has been transmitted over
standard analogue or ISDN lines during an
Internet session. I t processes a vast array
of protocols used online and presents the
recorded Internet session i n a neat and
user friendly format.

The software will process sessions that have
been p r e v i o u s l y r e c o r d e d b y l a w
enforcement agencies using professional
digital recording equipment. MADE runs on
standard Windows operating systems. Files
from captured Internet sessions can b e
displayed in their original applications such
as emails (complete with attachments) in
Microsoft Outlook Express, web content in
Internet Explorer, transferred documents in
Microsoft Word etc. as appropriate.

Komcept MADE reveals the username and
password o f t h e individual opening t h e
Internet session and will capture all activity
when known protocols are utilized.

The approach taken b y b o t h software
applications allows both t o be integrated
into existing monitoring centres, saving
infrastructure, time and cost.

Recorder

Komcept Solutions' recorders give you full fidelity audio reproduction of voice, fax and
data transmitted over the telecommunications network.
Equipment that will record telephone conversations rarely has the quality t o wholly
reproduce not only the words but the meaning of the words — Komcept's recorders can
give you this.
Both digital and analogue recorders are
available.
The Analogue recorder will accept up to
48 analogue telephone lines f r o m
standard copper-pair taps.
The El/T1 Digital recorder may receive
up to 64 telephone channels on two El
trunks, recording calls in either voice
operated or ctone triggered mode, or by
a digital signalling method. All signalling
systems can b e accepted, including
GISH, Q.391 DSS1, DASS and DPNSS.

Included w i t h a l l recorders a r e
feature-packed transcription software
licenses which allow standard PCs
connected with recorders over a n
ethernetwork to play and transcribe all
calls a t will. Alternative language
options are available. Fax and data
calls may be automatically decoded
with the addition of a Fax and data
processor, a l s o available f r o m
Korricept.

KSL Recorders will report all call related
data such as DTMF, CLI and Pulse tone
dials, a s well a s a n y GSM location
information etc. supplied via the digital
signalling from the intercepting switch.
Audio can b e stored i n mono and
binaural, A-Law, p-Law and 16-bit linear.

Komcept Solutions' database system
can l i n k a l l KSL Recorders a n d
transcription machines together t o
collate call related data for efficient
activity monitoring a n d h i s t o r y
preservation. More recorders may be
added allowing a modular expansion
of the system over time.

The recorders have an optional CD or
DVD recorder for permanent evidential
archiving o f recorded calls. They may
have larger arrays of hard disks to record
for months or years without the worry of
running out of space, or be connected to
a Network Attached Storage (NAS)
device.

With fast and easy exporting
to analytical applications such
as 12, all communication may
be visually connected to add to
the bigger picture and aid live
operations.

Komcept Solutions' recorders give you full fidelity audio reproduction of voice, fax
and data transmitted over the telecommunications network.
Graphical interfaces and optional processing tools provide you with a complete
armoury for telephone interception using individual modules to scale your system
for your needs and price, and allowing it to be built upon over time.
Analogue Telephone Interception
The Analogue Recomfer provides L a w
Enforcement with a comprehensive facility for
the u n intrusive interception o f analogue
telephone circuits. High impedance parallel
connections to target lines can be routed to the
interface which will detect activity on the line
and record both sides of the conversation. All
call related data (Caller ID, DTMF, MF, Pulse
Dial) is decoded by the recorder and stored for
presentation upon playback.
Analogue Interception with Call Routing
The Analogue Recorder is best used where the
targets' telephone lines have been routed to
the recording centre. If this is not possible but
access t o the switch is available then the
Analogue Recorder may be customised t o
route all calls from the telephone switch to the
recording centre over another analogue line
(Remoterap) or a DSL-line (VPN Recorder).
Switch/LI Software Dial-up Receiving
The Dial-up Recorder is designed for situations
where interception is provided through switch
software and the intercepted product is routed

from the switch on a digital (ISDN) dial-up
connection. The Dial-up Recorder is capable of
receiving this intercepted product on one or
more ISDN trunks, as well as data channels for
CALEA 1-STD-025A o r ETSI ES201 6 7 1
compatible signalling. The dial-up recorder
takes a primary rate ISDN Q931 connection
and can be configured to all national standards.
Digital Trunk Interception
The El Activity Recordermay receive up to 120
simultaneous telephone channels on four El
trunks, recording calls in either voice operated
or c-tone triggered mode, o r by a digital
signalling method. A l l standard signalling
systems can be accepted including GISH, SS7,
DASS and DPNSS.
GSM Interception
Komcept S o l u t i o n s ' o w n A - I n t e r f a c e
Interception System allows the capture and
analysis o f t h e data o n t h e A-interface
(between the MSC and BSC) of a GSM network.
It keeps a live database to provide translations
between TMSIs and target IMSIs to which they
relate. This can be scaled for a small system
right up to a multi-sited GSM network.

Interception Systems offered by Komcept Solutions for :
Analogue telephone interception.
Analogue interception with call routing.
Switch/LI software dial-up receiving.
Digital trunk interception.
GSM interception.
PBX monitoring.

Available to enhance Komcept Solutions interception systems

PBX Monitoring
The PBX Monitor offers the unintrusive interception o f a
majority o f digital PBX telephone circuits. High impedance
parallel connections to target lines can be routed to the monitor
which will detect, analyse and decode the activity on the line
and record the resulting audio and call related data. Up to 96
digital lines can be monitored and recorded by each monitor.
All call related data (Caller ID, DTMF, MF) is recorded and can
be displayed when replaying the calls.
The range of digital PBX switches and handsets which can be
monitored is constantly growing.

Modem Decoding - D i a l
Modem
Decoding requires a four-wire tap to record both
directions of the call; differences between Fax and Modem
up I n t e r n e t
are substantial in the way data is intercepted - fax being
possible from a 2-wire tap. The recorded .wav file from the
4-wire tap is stored, and processed through the Modem
decoding server.

Broadband Internet
Depending upon the architecture of the operator's network,
there are various ways a Komcept Solutions' Broadband
Interception System can monitor a target's broadband line.
With the high data rates of modern broadband connections
the product can be filtered to only store relevant material,
for example between certain times, just email, particular
web sites etc. The Delta SeePro application presents the
whole session neatly and conveniently organised.

Call Playback
The Komcept Solutions Digital Player is a software application
for a call replay machine based on a Windows PC. When used
in conjunction with Komcept's Lawful Interception suite i t
provides a versatile playback facility packed with features for
the displaying and decoding of called/calling numbers, flexible
filtering and sorting, looping and flagging, amongst a host of
other tools. The population of a Word Processor transcription
document can be controlled from within the Player, saving
much of the operator's time.
For mobile targets SMS messages and location information can
be displayed instantly.
This product is normally supplied free of charge with Komcept
Solutions recorders.

Geradus, Komcept
own mapping application,
displays the likely location o f a target based upon their
location messages from a GSM interception system, and cell
locations from the CSP (Cellular Service Provider). Geradus
displays a navigable history o f a target's whereabouts,
allows time-filtering, and alarms when they move. I t is
based upon best-guess geography of cell usage.

Fax Processing

Fax calls recorded on any of the Lawful Interception suite's
recorders can be processed and decoded, producing an image
of t h e transmitted fax. T h i s process i s automatic when
connected to the Lawful Interception network, yet can also be
used standalone with fax calls fed into it as .wav files.

With eight independent trigger inputs and a fully programmable array of messages and
recipient lists, the GSM Alarm Annunciator adds flexibility and assurance to your systems.

Whether you need your equipment to
send y o u a n a l e r t w h e n s y s t e m
resources run low, or to reassure you an
event o c c u r s , t h e G S M A l a r m
Annunciator will get the message across.
With two-way GSM communication, the
recipient can text back to acknowledge
the alarm, cancelling it. I n fact, full
interactivity is provided via SMS; users
can check t h e status o f any alarm,
cancel alarms, and trigger outputs lines.
It c a n e v e n b e configured t o

The inputs a n d outputs a r e totally
isolated to ensure that the GM-8 does
not influence o r h a r m t h e existing
equipment. Connection is simple and
either a 5 V logic level o r a closing
contact can instigate an alarm.

allowing you t o b e as descriptive ( o r
ambiguous) as desired.
Adding t o the security resume o f this
device, there are various configurable
levels o f access control; m e s s a g e
identifier, p a s s w o r d s , a u t h o r i s e d

Iridium Monitoring System

!MOS 1 1

The Iridium Satellite Telephone System was conceived in 1987 and was the first private
global mobile satellite telephone system with complete coverage of the earth including
oceans, airways and polar regions.
The Iridium Satellite Telephone System uses a mesh network of 66 low earth orbit satellites to
provide full coverage of the earth. Calls from handsets on the ground to satellites are passed
through the satellite network to a satellite currently in communication with a ground station where
they are passed to the international public telephone network.
Consequently, monitoring can be achieved only for calls and satellites in range of the monitoring
antenna.
The satellite network switches calls between adjacent satellites and between spot-beams on each
satellite to provide frequency re-use and highly targeted antenna gain.
The tactical monitoring unit, IMDS, uses one circularly polarised antenna to receive both the
transmissions from all satellites in view and from all handsets in line-of-sight range. These signals
are converted to an intermediate frequency where they are processed in a software receiver using
the latest digital signal processing techniques.
Processing of the received signals is carried out in the processing unit which analyses call content
and call related information to provide a clear display front end for the operator.

The Iridium Monitoring Unit, IMDS can be supplied in a portable or fixed format
depending on the requirement. Replay of the data and content can be supplied to
a network of PC based operator terminals allowing more than one operator to access
the system.
The system is capable of receiving, demodulating and presenting voice calls, SMS
messages, data traffic and FAX messages. I t will monitor the active satellites in view
and their antenna spot-beams. T h e system will allow targeting of handsets using
TMSI, IMSI or NEI and can detect and present the handset's geographic location.
A mapping application provides the operator with a visual indication of the location
of the target handsets.

Technical Specification
IMDS Fixed Version:
Rack mountable with a powerful processing engine and Network Attached storage.
Playback on an array of desktop Pcs, scalable for any desired sized monitoring centre.
IMDS Portable Version:
Rugged luggable PC providing decode and processing with playback on one or several
laptop PCs.

The Iridium Satellite Telephone System
The original configuration was for a constellation of 77 low earth orbit (LEO) satellites and was named after the atom Iridium
which has 77 orbiting electrons. I n an effort to minimise satellite usage, the constellation was optimised and the number of
satellites was reduced to 66. I t is the largest commercial satellite system in the world.
The satellite constellation comprises 11 satellites in 6 orbital planes operating as a fully
meshed network and is supported by in-orbit spares. Each satellite is in communication
with 4 others, 1 satellite in each adjacent plane as well as the two satellites each side
of it in the same plane.
Iridium satellites orbit at 780km from the earth's surface and the orbit time is 100
minutes giving an in-view time of between 9 and 10 minutes. Each plane is separated
by 31.6° and each satellite has an antenna which has 48 spot beams arranged as 16
beams in 3 sectors.
Communication to handsets from the satellite uses L-band, 1.616 GHz to 1.625 GHz.
Communication between satellites is an Ku band, 23.18 GHz to 23.38 GHz and links
operate at 10Mb/s. The communication between the satellite and ground user uses a
TDMA and FDMA based system and uses QPSK modulation. Each timeslot is 8.2ms long
and sits in a 90ms frame. Within each FDMA channel there are four TDMA timeslots in
each direction.
The TDMA frame starts off with a 20.32 ms period which is used for simple messaging to devices such as pagers and to alert
Iridium phones of an incoming call, followed by four upstream slots and four downstream slots. Small guardbands are used
between each timeslot. Channels are spaced at 41.666 kHz and each channel occupies a bandwidth of 31.5 MHz to allow space
for doppler shifts.
The Iridium voice communications links use an Advanced Multi-band Excitation codec which reduces the bandwidth to 2.4
kbaud.

Thuraya Monitoring

The Thuraya satellite network was introduced in 2001 and allows a user to make calls from any
area covered by the satellite using a Thuraya hand-held mobile phone, similar in size to a cellular
telephone. T h e advantage over conventional GSM telephones is that the user is able to make
calls from places where terrestrial GSM coverage is poor or non-existent.
Komcept Solutions Ltd is able to supply off-air monitoring equipment for the Thuraya network,
enabling Law Enforcement Agencies to identify users of the system and their precise locations.

experienced engineers and only basic site
facilities and services are required from the
customer. Typically a C-band dish antenna
between 7 and 9 metres is required to receive
the satellite C-band downlink.

Spotbeam coverage

The addition in 2008 of the Thuraya 3 satellite situated
over Borneo has increased the coverage to include the
Far East and Australasia.

Tactical:
The Thuraya Tactical Monitoring System is a

handset users in the local operational theatre.
The system i s highly portable and can b e
rapidly disassembled and moved t o another
area as circumstances dictate. Good choice of
monitoring location and use o f an antenna
mast, provide greater range for the handset
uplink signal which is line-of sight and the only
limiting factor in deployment of the system.
Operation from a vehicle battery is a standard
feature of the tactical system which is housed

be either tactical or strategic for
the most effective and timely
intelligence.

Recent years have seen a surge i n hand held satellite telecommunications systems largely due t o t h e
development of technology both in the handsets and also on the satellite. Because they are easy to use, portable
and can be used almost anywhere, they are the communications tool of choice for many criminals and terrorists.
Thuraya Monitoring:
The Thuraya satellite network currently covers f r o m
Scandinavia, the UK and Spain in the West to the Far East
and Australasia in the East using two geostationary satellites.
The network will provide voice, SMS, fax and data over an
L-band radio path. T h e antenna on each Thuraya satellite
forms an array o f spot-beams. These are similar t o the
cellular coverage of a GSM network, providing the antenna
gain necessary f o r a hand-held communications system
using a geostationary satellite.

Inma rsat Monitoring:
Inmarsat were the first to provide satellite based
communications networks and their Inmarsat M
and mini-M terminals are still very widely used.
The newer systems based on their Global Area
Network (GAN), concept provide facilities f o r
faster data communications.
Recently, collaboration w i t h ACeS h a s given
Inmarsat a hand-held voice terminal, IsatPhone,
to allow it to compete with Thuraya and Iridium.
Coverage of IsatPhone is currently Africa and a
large part of Asia, with little or no coverage of
Europe at the present time.
Like Thuraya, IsatPhone coverage of the Americas
is planned for the near future.

Iridium Monitoring:
Iridium uses a network of 66 low earth orbit satellites to
provide full global coverage including all sea masses and the
North and South Poles. I t is the world's largest commercial
satellite network. T h e system uses 11 low-earth orbit
satellites in each of the 6 orbital planes and each satellite
communicates with its 4 nearest neighbours. U s e of spot
beams requires significant switching and control of calls. A
single call may be switched between several satellites in its
duration.

Thuraya
The Thuraya Tactical Monitoring System (TIMS) is a transportable receiver
mounted into a rugged peli-case which receives the L-band transmissions
from both the satellite and handset. Designed as a portable system it is
ideal for vehicle based monitoring in the field. T w o antennas capture
transmissions from the satellite and handset which are converted to an
intermediate frequency before processing in the digital signal processing
engine.
The Thuraya Strategic Monitoring System (ISMS) uses a large dish
antenna to intercept the C-band downlink signals from the satellite to the
Thuraya ground station and a smaller antenna to intercept the L-band
downlink signals from the satellite to the handset. A l l communication in
both directions between handset and satellite is received by the system,
including locations of all handsets. U s i n g additional L-band receivers,
coverage can be extended to cover the whole C-band footprint.

TTMS - Thuraya Tactical
Monitoring System

Inmarsat
Inmarsat M and mini-M terminals use the Inmarsat
3 family of satellites and, as with Thuraya, both
tactical and strategic monitoring solutions can be
provided.
Inmarsat IsatPhone terminals u s e t h e n e w
Inmarsat 4 satellites a n d transponders f o r
IsatPhone are currently installed on the EMEA and
Asia pacific satellites.

Inmarsat BGAN is the new high speed data service
which uses the Inmarsat 4 family o f satellites.
Komcept Solutions and its partners are currently
working on a solution for monitoring this service.
Inmarsat

Iridium
Due to the design of the network and the
number o f satellites, o n l y tactical
interception o f I r i d i u m i s possible.
Communication between satellite a n d
handset is on L-band and the Iridium
monitoring system uses a two channel
down-converter a n d d i g i t a l s i g n a l
processing engine to monitor separately
the up-link and down-link channels. The
signal processing u n i t carries o u t
registration o f t h e I r i d i u m signals,
identifying the satellite, spot-beam, subband, time-slot and frequency o f each
signal. A l l captured d a t a c a n b e
