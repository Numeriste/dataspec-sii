obtaining a POA geolocation result using a synchronised
RFeye network, an individual Node can be selected based on
proximity to the signal for targeted time captures and further
detailed analysis.
Signals analysis and recognition

Power on Arrival is an amplitude comparison radiolocation
technique that is effective over the short distances involved
with in-building monitoring, due to the initial rapid dropoff in received signal power with distance from the target
transmitters. It is well suited to the multitude of potential
signal types that are sources of interference or indicators
of covert activity, as the principle is independent of signal
bandwidth or modulation type.The proprietary SyncLincTM
system from CRFS avoids the need for (or vulnerability from)
re-radiating GPS indoors for synchronization between RFeye
Nodes, and instead offers a dedicated, purpose designed and
robust synchronization technique that enables highly effective
localization of detected transmitters.

Extensive and powerful data processor modules and process
chains in RFeye Site can be combined and customized to

Sweeps and time captures

provide in-depth signals analysis data that can in turn be fed
into notifications, alarms and reports. Modules can filter and
recognise signals including modulation type and channelized

There is a multitude of potential signal types that are the
sources of interference, indicators of illegal activity or
unauthorised spectrum use. Direction Finding and geolocation
techniques are each effective only for a limited range of
target signal types, which varies according to many factors
including signal bandwidth, modulation, power, background
noise, pulse duration and receiver speed.The most reliable
and cost effective method to ensure detection and successful
localization of the maximum range of target signal types is
to combine and augment each technique in a single real-time

The RFeye Array 300 is fully self-contained within a robust IP65 rated radome designed for hostile conditions. Close coupling
of the RFeye node and antenna modules reduces cable runs and cable losses and significantly improves RF performance.
Various directional antenna options are available from 300MHz to 18GHz and an RFeyeWatson-Watt module is available for VHF
transmissions down to 2OMHz.The system is modular and further channels can be added to improve probability of intercept.
Powerful software
Advanced GUI provides easy multi-mission control including 2417 continuous spectrum monitoring, programmable masks
