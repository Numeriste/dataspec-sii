Easy Setup

Rather than displaying several points when your team
member is carrying several different tracked items,
the system will auto-select the most accurate bearer
and display this one. If this feed should fail, the
system will jump to the next most accurate bearer.

The system allows for easy setup and integration
with your existing tracking systems including:

De-confliction alerts will trigger and alert you when
different surveillance teams come into close
proximity. 'Safe Areas' can be created and alerts
triggered if other teams enter your 'patch'.

Motion Detection is easily configured by setting
a region of interest along with size based filters .
Argus uses these filters to assign each trigger
a confidence level. This means that Argus will
still trigger even if it's set-up is sub optimal .
Confidence can be enhanced through the use
of virtual tripwires which allow users to target
specific features for greater control.

Results are displayed without delay as the
video footage is analyzed in a filmstrip which
runs along the bottom of the screen . Alarms
are ordered by confidence and can be viewed,
labeled, exported printed or deleted. A yellow
box highlights the object that caused the alarm
event easing event identification and analysis .

Argus incorporates multi-codec video review
software that is compatible with most systems
deployed by the police and military. Users can
review the entire footage or just the material
around captured alarm events. Review is aided
by activity graphs that show where motion and
alarm events occurred in the scene. The video
reviewer allows users to manually bookmark
videos and facilitates the export of video
segments.
