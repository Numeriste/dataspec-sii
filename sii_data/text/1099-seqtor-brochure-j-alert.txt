Discover Illegal Jamming

Key Applications

Recent years have seen a significant rise in the use and
availability of illegal jamming devices. These devices are
used to defeat surveillance and security eQJipment induding
cellular devices (audio/video). GPS and LOJACK tracking.
While jamming of signals is itself illegal in most countries,
identifying when a jammer is in use has always been difficult.
until now! - the J-ALERT makes jammer detection and
tracking easy, safe and cost effective.

Law Enforcement I Toll Authorities
J-ALERT will detect jamrners in use by criminals trying to
circumvent GSM/GPS and LOJACK based tracking systems or people trying to defeat GSM/GPS based toll bridge
payment systems.

The J-ALERT is an RF signal analyzer that monitors Cellular
Radio FreQJencies, GPS and LOJACK to determine if the
target is actively jamming these signals. When the J-ALERT
detects jamming in the cellular bands a corresponding LED
will light to indicate the Received Signal Strength (RSSI) of
the Jammer and which band is being jammed. When GPS L1
frEq.Jency and a cellular band or LOJACK is being jammed
a bar graph indcation of jammer received signal strength
(RSSI) from the jamrner is displayed enabling tracking. If both
a cellular band and GPS L1 are being jammed simultaneously
or if Lojack is being jammed a beep will sound every 3 sec. to
alert the operator a jamrner is in use. The J-ALERT also has
a stereo jack on the back of the unit with both N/O and N/C
contacts for triggering an external device on alerts such as a
camera for taking pictures of license plates.

Jammers are being used by criminals in an increasing and
alarming high number to defeat and cheat not only commercial onboard navigation and recovery systems but also
Law Enforecement tracking systems.
Each day of the year Toll Authorities and Road Pricing
Authorities are loosing millions of dollars in revenue as more
and more ordinary people are defeating Toll Bridge systems
by installing a simple 100 dollar GSM/GPS jamrner in their
vehicle or cargo truck - a jamrner that is easily available on
the internet although it is illegal using such device in most
countries.
FrEq.Jently criminals transporting drugs and contraband
will operate jammers to defeat law enforcement tracking
efforts even if they only think they are being tracked by law
enforcement. This is a great Interdiction Tool for officers to
form grounds to stop vehicles. (Probable cause I Reasonable and Probable Grounds)
