GSM/GPS Tri-bandTracking System
The T1 is the second generation version of the HTSI invehicle tracking systems. Its unique performing, size and
cutting edge power management makes this system truly one
of a kind.

Data logging

Besides live tracking from the CP2 software via GPRS, SMS
or Data the T1 it self can be configured via various timers
and triggers to report back to the software when specific
events happen. Live tracking ofthe unit has no influence on
the memory data logging. The system will also show GSM
Cell ID, GSM signal strength and number of satellites
in use when ever it's reporting to the CP2 software, essential
for confidence in the unit.

GSM
Using a tri-band GSM modem the system can be deployed
in any GSM network around the globe. The system will always
report the GSM Cell ID: ideal in situations where GPS may be
lost.

GeoFence
The T1 supports 48 configurable GeoFence areas. The system
can be configured to trigger alarm messages and log data
when leaving or/and entering defined areas. The GeoFence
areas can also be linked to the Inputs so alarms only will
be triggered when activated inside or outside an area.

mm

Dynamic GeoFence
The T1 can be set to automatically GeoFence itself. The
system will activate a GeoFence zone around a fixed area
whenever the ignition input is switched off.

Inputs I outputs
The T1 has 8 inputs and 2 outputs. 4 inputs can be linked
to the GeoFence areas. The inputs can also directly trigger
an output. The unit also has an internal motion sensor.
