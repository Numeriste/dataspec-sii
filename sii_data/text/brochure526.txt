ION: Non-Attribution for Asset Communications
ION solutions are built on proprietary technologies that provide multiple layers of indirection,
ensuring no link exists between mission personnel and their assets, or between assets. With
technologies that transcend simple non-attribution, our hardened security leaves no trace of
operational communication. By segmenting all assets and personnel into separate access and
communications paths, propagation of a single exposure is prevented: -Yq

ION enables solution customization to support modes of communication that guarantee confidentiality
and security between headquarters, deployed personnel, and assets. Critical mission communications
will never be attributable to any customer, Ntrepid, or any other entity that would raise suspicion.
