10 GigaBit Fiber Taps
Get total traffic visibility for monitoring and security devices by placing Net Optics
10 GigaBit Fiber Taps on critical network links. The new slim profile of the 10
GigaBit Fiber Tap saves rack space—install up to six Taps in a one rack unit panel.
The all-optical design of the 10 GigaBit Fiber Tap is optimized and tested for
high-performance on 10 GigaBit fiber networks. Available for both singlemode and
multimode fiber, 10 GigaBit Fiber Taps support passive monitoring of GigaBit links
at speeds at 10,000 Mbps.
Requiring no power, the 10 GigaBit Fiber Taps maintain permanent passive access
ports without introducing a point of failure or disturbing other network connections.
These passive Taps deliver full-duplex monitoring with zero impact on network
traffic around the clock.
Full-duplex monitoring is a snap with a custom monitoring cable that sends each
side of the signal to a separate NIC on the monitoring device. All network and
monitoring cables necessary for plug-and-play deployment are included.
Without an IP address, monitoring devices are isolated from the network,
dramatically reducing their exposure to attacks. However, the monitoring device
connected to the Tap still sees all full-duplex traffic as if it were in-line, including
Layer 1 and Layer 2 errors.

Passive, Secure Technology

• Provides passive access at speeds at 10,000 Mbps without data stream
interference or introducing a point of failure
• All-optical design is optimized and tested for 10 GigaBit fiber networks
• Permanent in-line installation without affecting network performance
• Passes all full-duplex traffic (including errors) from all layers for comprehensive
troubleshooting
• No IP address is needed for the Tap or monitoring device, enhancing monitoring
security
• Completely transparent to the network and requires no power

Front-mounted connectors make installation and operation quick and easy
Connectors are perfectly angled to reduce cable strain
Silk-screened application diagram illustrates all connections for easy deployment
Optional 19-inch rack frame holds up to 6 Taps
Tested and compatible with all major manufacturers’ monitoring devices,
including protocol analyzers, probes, and intrusion detection/prevention systems
