The challenge of IP Data
Retention to Traditional Approach

Summary
The challenge
The typical solution
Retentia’s approach
DRS: the solution for IP data
retention
The company

Reference Scenario
International and national regulations set mandatory
requirements on transactions to be retained and query
response time
Privacy and security regulations define data protection
rules and access criteria
Enterprises are willing to spend as little as possible on
data retention
Increase in traffic and monitored transactions is pushing
the managed data size to the sky

Meeting all these conflicting requirements is a big
challenge for system designers and developers
Time is ripe for a dedicated software product

The IP challenge (size)
IP data retention is making the task more
challenging
Huge amount of data if compared to traditional
phone CDR volumes
A typical user makes tens of phone calls but
might send and receive hundreds of mails and
browse thousands of web pages and images

The IP challenge (flexibility)
Small differences in legislation from country to
country might impact heavily on system
requirements
Changes over time in regulation might impact
heavily on the volume of data managed by the
system

The IP challenge (adaptability)
The type and size of data to be stored and
managed is very variable compared to standard
telephony CDR
Telephony CDR are very standard and well
defined objects; from their correctness depends
the phone bill
IP CDR may range from IP packets to system
logs

The IP challenge (definition)
Depending on standard definitions and
country regulations, exists a gray area
between data retention and interception

Interception

The “easy” answer
A system with high data management capability
Very customizable and scalable
Able to manage all sorts of data

We need an RDBMS!!!

What is the price?
performance (many CPU)
storage (many TB)
licenses
management
security

$$$ TCO $$$

The DRS answer
Data to be managed is known in advance
Queries to be run are known in advance
configuration phase

any data
any query

The DRS answer
Using, during the system configuration phase,
the knowledge on data to be managed and
queries to be run in the configuration phase, we
can deliver a significantly more efficient system
Adding more data flows or modifying data
formats and queries is simply done, often in
minutes, with a new configuration

The real-life results
billions of record managed with PC class
hardware
up to 80% storage savings compared to DB
guaranteed query response time
total data protection due to proprietary
encrypted data file format

The Process Management
Challenge
In today Telco/ISP scenario the management and
handling of LEA requests is becoming an
increasingly complex task
Enforcement and monitoring of SLA
Multiple Data Repositories
Complete control and tracing of data access
Monitoring of request handling process
Security of data communication with LEAs
Reducing operator costs

The DRS answer
DRS provides a single access point for all LEA support activities enforcing
security and tracking of accesses
It can manage Data Retention queries as well as provisioning of Legal
Interception requests
DRS provides a centralized monitoring of all process phases
The web interface can be securely accessed from remote (ideally directly
from LEA)
The process streamlining capability and simplified request input screens
can dramatically improve the whole process efficiency
DRS provides a virtual repository access, masking the complexity of
repositories from operators
Centralized process monitoring and scheduling of requests helps in
meeting SLA
DRS is already handling the HI1 interface

Process management = security + savings

The complete picture
The Data Retention Suite is a complete suite of software products that
manages the processing of requests from LEAs using a centralized
architecture. The Suite is composed by 3 main products:

DRS/wm
! DRS/wm (Workflow Management) handles all process phases (incoming
requests management, services splitting, storage system interface
management, multi-repository virtualization, etc)

DRS/db and DRS/fs
!Archiving and fast retrieval of traffic stored on Data Base (/db) or File
Systems (/fs) based storage architecture in a compressed and encrypted
format.
Secure and fast retrieval of traffic data, to support service level agreement.
DRS/fs significantly reduce storage dedicated to data retention.
