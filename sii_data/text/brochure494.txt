GLOBAL ASSISTED-GPS TRACKER
The FreightWatch Geo F5 Global Tracker is a value-priced, location tracking and
sensor monitoring device with enhanced assisted-GPS provided by the FSNtracks
platform. Based on industry-leading location-positiontechnology, the F5 operates
in impaired environments where most GPS trackers do not. When the Geo F5 is
unable to receive direct GPS signals, the FSNtracks system uses cell tower
location data instead to "triangulate" the location of the device. The
FreightWatch Geo F5 is a best-in-class, embeddable tracking device that works
worldwide wherever GSMIGPRS cellular coverage is available for global and
cross-border applications.
Superior battery management enables
the F5 to remain deployed in remote
locations for long periods of time-even
more than one year. Combined with the
FSNtracks online "track and trace" service,
the Geo F5 provides a complete solution
for enterprise, industrial and law
enforcement tracking applications.

Deployment scenarios include
tracking packages, valuable
assets and personnel
Onboard temperature and light
sensors
Wide range of external battery
options
'Low Duty Cycle" hibernation
option extends battery life to a
year or more
Battery status on demand and
automatically with location
reports
Unit can be configured
over-the-air remotely
Secure, browser-based user
interface
