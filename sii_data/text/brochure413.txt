WolfhoundTM-Lite is a belt-worn, wireless sniffer specifically tuned to the RF signature of common cell phones
including PCS, CDMA / WCDMA, GSM and Cellular bands. WolfhoundTM-Lite's high speed scanning receiver utilizes a multi-band, external omni-directional antenna system allowing security personnel to locate all nearby cell
phones actively using voice, text (SMS) or data transmissions. WolfhoundTM-Lite's compact and discreet design
makes it the perfect stealth tool for enforcing your NO WIRELESS security policy in universities, government &
military installations, court rooms, law enforcement agencies, financial institutions, prisons & correctional facilties. WolfhoundTM-Lite'ssimple, pager-sized design prevents wireless usage by alerting the operator via an OLED
screen and/or vibrating alerts that detect and even aid in locating the wireless perpetrator.
