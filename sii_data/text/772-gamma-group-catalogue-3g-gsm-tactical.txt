OVERVIEW

Cellular networks have created a haven for criminals and terrorists
Over GSM & 30 networks, criminals and terrorist can remain anonymous, able to continue illegal
activities on a global scale without fear of action because:
• N o Local Registration is required—criminals are able to use pre-paid SIM cards or foreign SIM
cards without the need to supply any information
• Post-Paid Subscription Fraud—criminals are easily able to reprogram phones with a fake identity
or use stolen phones and SIM cards
Although p o w e r f u l Strategic/Countrywide
surveillance monitoring tools are atthe disposal of
Law Enforcement Agencies, the ability to monitor
specific criminals/targets critically requires
having specific target identity data. In the case
of cellular networks the fundamental information
is the IMSI (unique identifier or serial number of
the SIM) and the IMEI (unique identifier or serial
number of the handset).
The IMSI and IMEI is highly prized data, and
to protect users it is not normally transmitted
within cellular networks. However, if the data is
obtained then Law Enforcement Agencies have
all they need to monitor Target(s), The challenge
is how to overcome the protective security
messages within cellular networks protecting
their subscribers and covertly elicit specific target
user data.
Fortunately, to assist Law Enforcement Agencies
we are able to offer solutions which can overcome
these challenges. Tactical off-air solutions are
available which are able to emulate the cellular
network in order to:

2. Identify & Locate 36 Target(s) cell-phones

Determine and locate the identity of aTarget(s) 30
cell-phone by pretending to be the real network
and tricking the phone to register accordingly.
This process allows the unique identity of the
phone (IMEI) and the SIM card IIMSI) to be
covertly captured, and designated Targets to be
precisely located.
3. IntercepttheVoiceandSMSCommunication
of Designated Targets

The communication o f Target(s) under
surveillance can b e captured without their
knowledge, including:
• a l l Voice calls & SMS either made or received
byTarget(s)
• spoof the identity of Target(s) to falsely send
SMS orVoice calls
• divert Calls/SMS so they are not received by
theTarget(s)
• t h e ability to edit all SMS before they are
received by theTarget(s)

1. Identify & Locate GSM Target(s) Cellphones

Determine and locate the identity of a Target(s)
GSM cell-phone by pretending to be the real
network and tricking the phone to register
accordingly This process allows the unique
identity of the phone WEI) arid the SIM card
(IMSI) to be covertly captured, and designated a
Target to be precisely located.

BACKGROUND OVERVIEW

GSM/3GNETWORKOVERVIEW
GSM is a cellular network, i.e., made up of many cells where each cell contains a Basestation through
which subscribers access the Network.The basestation is the fundamental network component which
routes all signaling and communications over the air between the cell-phone and Network.
To ensure countrywide connectivity, many thousands of basestations are usecLTransmitting on a different
frequency to ensure there is no interference, the cell-phone constantly monitors the signal strength
of its surrounding basestations. As a subscriber moves, the cell-phone will join the most attractive
basestation available to ensure optimum network connectivity,This is an automatic action happening in
the background to the ignorance of the user,

Me Network BasesimMons around them

GSM & 3G cellular networks use only 2 unique identifiers: the IMSI (cell-phone identity) and IMEI (SIM
card identity) To protect a subscriber's identity the IMSI & IMEI are only transmitted over the air in certain
cases: when cellphones are switched on or when crossing special cell boundaries between different LAC
(Local Area Code). Networks use instead a 3
to communicate with a cell-phone, a temporary identity which is continually changed throughout the day.

BACKGROUND OVERVIEW

GSMIDENTITYCAPTURE
The ability to covertly monitor designated targets is virtually impossible without first knowing the identity
of the Target(s) cellphone. The behavior of Targets who are constantly changing phones or SIM cards
makes this much harder especially when there may only he limited engagement opportunities.
Working off-air, solutions today take advantage of the requirement for the cell-phone to continually
search for the strongest valid network cell. Emulating a valid network cell they will transmit a more
attractive signal to attract cell-phones to join,The process of joining results in the cell-phone providing its
unique IMSI & IMEI details.
Now Law Enforcement Agencies can target specific cell-phones to covertly obtain their details. It is
relatively straightforward within GSM networks to obtain the IMSI & IMEI providing the correct cell is
emulated. A cell-phone only actively monitors the 6 strongest neighboring cells.To grabTarget(s) requires
emulating one of these neighbor cells. Solutions today will aid users in this cell selection process.

Off-air equipment emulate the
network and transrdtt a afake cell
which is more attractive than the real network

OVERVIEW

BACKGROUND OVERVIEW

Although acquiring IMSI & IMEI is very fast, the real challenge lies in filtering out the Targeds) identity
from unwanted collateral.
For example, operating within busy or crowded areas will result in many thousands of identities being
acquired, most of whom will not be of interest or unwanted collateral.
The conventional operating procedure is to physically follow theTargeds), grab identities across multiple
locations and look for common IMSI & IMEI.
This can be time consuming and often not practical given the careful behavior of organized criminals &
terrorists.
It is much more efficient to operate as close as possible to theTargeds) at minimal transmission power.
This will reduce the system footprint/area of coverage and hence unwanted collateral.

GSMTARGETLOCATING
Once the IMSI & IMEI of a Target is known, a cellphone can be grabbed and forced to transmit.
Commonly known as a 'Blind' or 'Silent' call, the
cell-phone transmits without the knowledge of its
target.
This RF transmission, normally set to a quiet IV
channel where there are no other transmissions,
can then be precisely located to within a few
metres using vehicular or body worn/handheld
direction finding systems_

VEHICLEINSTALLATION OVERVIEW
INTRODUCTION

INSTALLATION DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

This document provides information regarding
the process of making a permanent installation of
the Unit PV variant in a vehicle.

There are two broad design philosophies that
may influence decisions taken during the vehicle
installation process:

It presumes a basic familiarity with GSM
networking and the Unit system.

• Covert, where it is of the utmost importance
that a vehicle retains the outward appearance
of a stook factory model
• Optimum performance, where the main
priority is to achieve maximal performance
from the unit

Key features of the proposed solution include:
• Integrated 26 and 36 solution
• Optional antenna strategies
• Choice of recommended vehicle installations

The requirements dictated by these design
philosophies often run counter to one another, so
it is important that consideration be undertaken
ahead of the installation about where priorities
lie.

ANTENNA CONFIGURATION

For this installation, directional antennas were mounted on both sides of the vehicle under the large trim
panel that forms the back bumper and part of the rear wings.

The antennas were angled slightly upwards to optimize use of the beam pattern. Cables were fed back
through access points in the vehicle paneling so thatwhen the reartrim panel was replaced, the antennas
and cabling were completely concealed.

An omnidirectional antenna was integrated into the vehicle's factoryfitted "sharks fin" antenna on the
roof With the antenna cover replaced, a completely stock look was achieved.

DIRECTION FINDERS
PURPOSE

MODELGSM-DFB

The direction finder (DE) is intended for searching
and localizing handsets operating in GSM bands
900, 1800 and 1900MHz. I t is the additional
equipment for 45.1 stationary or portable active
system. The main idea of the targets direction
finding procedure is to register the required
mobile phone in the internal BIS and switch ON
its transmitter. The direction finder must be tuned
to the sameARFCN channel as the BTS. From this
moment the OF user will hear the detected sound
signals ot TOMA sequence which is natural for
GSM telephony.

While operating the OF, it is necessary to connect
it to the antenna connector of the corresponding
range. Rotating the antenna right or left allows
achieving the maximum in signal level reading
on the control unit LED or the maximum volume
level in the headphones. Depending on direction
and distance from the object, the volume level in
headphones will change. The maximum volume
of the sound signal is correlated with the target's
location. While the operator is approaching the
object being searched, it may he necessary to
change sensitivity of the device by switching on
3-stepped attenuator 10, 20, 30 dB. Attenuation
value is determined by experiment.

BACKGROUND OVERVIEW

3GNETWORKOVERVIEW
The demand for high speed communications and
faster data th roughput has excceded the capability
of GSM, a second generation communications
network. The next or 3rd generation network
is an evolution of GSM and uses CDMA (Code
Division Multiple Access) instead of TDMA (Time
Division Multiple Access) technology to achieve
much greater performance. Also known as UMTS
these networks are spreading rapidly with most
of Europe, Middle East and Asia already covered.
Current IMSI catching equipment, developed for
GSM, will not work on 313 networks. 313 differs
from GSM by using Scrambling Codes rather
thau frequencies to separate communications.
Apopular analogy to show the difference is in
aroom full of people; in 313 they all speak at the
same time whereas in GSM they take turns.The
reason why they can communicate when talking
at the same time is because they are speaking
different languages.

Each cell still contains a Basestation, now called
Node B through which subscribers access the
Network. Although the Node Bs transmit on the
same frequency they use different scrambling
codes to ensure there is no interference. Each
scrambling code is unique and will not interact
with another code. They appear 'noise like' yet
can be recovered and transmission is easily
reconstructed due to these properties.
As per GSM, a cell-phone will monitor the Node
Bs around its location and, if a stronger or more
attractive signal is seen, will jump to this Node
B. The approach of emulating a real cell and
transmitting a Fake cell to attract a cell-phone is
still valid, and as before, results in the cell-phone
providing its IMSI &

BACKGROUND OVERVIEW

KEYCHALLENGES
Although3G networks are much more efficientthey
require very careful power control management
to minimize the impact of interference. Although
a cell transmits on a different Scrambling Code,
essentially a noise-like signal, it is still transmitting
on the same frequency as its neighboring cells.
The net effect of each cell transmission is to
introduce more noise into the 3G network.
Management of the transmission power of each
cell is absolutely critical to limit their ability to
increase the noise. As noise levels increase
within the network, the size of the cell will reduce,
with the worst case cell-phones losing network
connectivity. To handle this eventuality the 3G
network use a back-up frequency to which they
switch subscribers.

A313ACTIVE system will emulate a real cell to
attract cell-phones. It has to transmit on the
same frequency as the real network albeit using
a different Scrambling Code. This raises the
possibility for the ACTIVE system to 'Jam the
network as it is putting essentially more noise
into the network. The process of covert identity
acquisition requires rejecting cellphones back
to the real network. it now, the ACTIVE system
also affects the quality of the real network, cellphones will be reluctant to rejoin a poorer 313
network and will either:
• take longer to rejoin the 3G network, they
will wait until the real network cell quality is
accepts ble.
• connect if they are allowed to the GSM
network as cell quality has dropped to an
unacceptable level.

• Choose I MSI Catching Cell configuration

• Choose IMSI Catching cell transmit power,
taking network cell power levels into
consideration. Note, the desired capture
distance is also very important: the larger the
fake cell created the greater the disruption.
Note, cell-phones closest to the system will

CONCLUSIONS
In comparison to GSM IMSI & IMEI acquisition,
the brief summon/ above shows IMSI Catching in
3G/UMIS is a much more complicated process.
Users require a detailed understanding of how313

by the network.
The complexity of 3G makes i t v e r y easy
to incorrectly use ACTIVE systems. The

consequences are potentially disastrous, and in
the worst case scenario can jam all 3G phones
in the deployment area. It is crucial for users to:
• Only use adequate technical solutions,
including 30 network training
• Acquire key cell parameters, such as Cell

• Transmit at minimum power levels

BLIND CALL FEATURES

36 Blind Call is a new software feature for the
36N UMTS system. It allows 36 phones to be
locked to the 36N and placed in a UMTS blind/
silent call for tracking purposes.
This is the only way to establish blind calls to
phones that are set in "36 only" mode, and it
removes the reliance on passing the 36 phone
to a GSM system for tracking—the target phone
stays on 36 frequencies at all times.
The313-DF can detect and track the signal from a
36 phone in a blind call, allowing the DF operator
to locate it.

• N e w Acquisition mode for the 36 and DF
target status for 36 phones makes operation
simple
• Multiple 36 blind calls can be supported by
each 36N Node B
• Automatic 36 power control ensures that
Node B and phone TX power are continually
adjusted to optimal levels to maintain the
blind call
• T h e 3GN can continue to take registration
from other 36 phones whilst maintaining a
blind call to the target phone

3G-DF FEATURES

BACKGROUND OVERVIEW

OVERVIEW
The cellular structure of GSM means all traffic
is communicated from the Network through a
Basestation to subscribers.This last step involves
transmitting over the air, the weakness, and,
hence, attack point for interception solutions.
To secure a Network, an Operator implements
encryption on the Traffic communication. 45.1
encryption is used to encrypt the Voice and SMS
communications within Europe, and for export
outside of Europe, 45.2 was developed,

A5.1DECRYPTION CHALLENGES
GSM uses the principle of a private and public key
to encrypt communications where the private key
is known only to the subscriber and Network. At
the start of each call, the subscriber will undergo
an Authentication process with the Network.
Once passed, each communication session will
be encrypted using a newly generated session
key called the Kc.
All 45.1 decryption solutions must derive the Ks
to decrypt the communication session. Although
attacks are openly published and well understood,
the challenge is to be able to do this in real-time
where real-time is defined as the time from when
the call-set-up process first starts, to when the
call is encrypted. This generally takes no more
than 2 seconds and the call must be decoded by
this point. The call will start frequency hopping,
which means the signal will iump to different prearrangedARFCN (Absolute RF channel number)
making it impossible to follow the call if the hop
sequence is not known,

Operators are now strengthening their Network
security. Called Randomization and already being
deployed in Europe, the available data required by
any solution is significantly reduced which means
most solutions will be seriously impacted.

OFF-AIR CAPABILITY
There are two fundamental approaches for the
interception of GSM communications:
• PASSIVE - completely covert, these solutions
do not transmit or interfere with the real
network. They monitor the cellular activity,
receiving and decoding the signalization and
communications over the air. This approach
captures all communications and is suited for
MASS Intercept, i.e. all calls within an area.
• MAN-IN-THE-MIDDLE - based on theACTIVE
solutions already described, these solutions
transmit a fake network to take control of
designated Targetls). Cloning their identity,
any communication either made or received
is decoded and monitored. This approach
captures only Targeted communication and
is suited for TARGETED Intercept, i.e. specific
calls in an area.

Outside Europe, there remains a security
weakness utilizing t h e availability o f 45.2.
Solutions were able to trick Target phones into
dropping to the weaker 45.2 standard to encrypt
the session, making it much easier to intercept.
This loophole is now closed, easily demonstrated
by trying to intercept the latest mobiles which
no longer are supplied with A5,2 support. The
complexity o f A5,1 means large amounts of
processing power is required to explore a II the
possible solutions to derive the (c. To further
reduce the possibility of intercept, Network

OVERVIEW

BACKGROUND OVERVIEW

OPERATIONALAPPLICATION
The different Operational scenarios or methods of possible deployment are: catch all communications
within an area (MASS Intercept) and catch only specific communications or (TARGETED Intercept).

MASS INTERCEPT
These solutions are optimized to capture all
communications within an area. They comprise
of a Receiver Front End and a Decryptor also
known as a Black Box. The Receiver captures
communications off-air, the Decryptor derives the
Kc to allow the communication to be deciphered.

Tohandle large traffic volumes ultra
Decryptors are required where typical decryption
speeds will exceed 4 KU&
In busy or city/urban environments many cells will
be used. Potentially to cover the 900 & 1800 GSM
Band, the receiver will need to handle a total of
512 RF channels. This means using Wideband

Receiver technology, they have the capability to
cover the complete RF band and are much more
effective in capturing communications.
Wideband Passive solutions are suitable for
highly tactical deployment; they can be covertly
used from vehicles or buildings very easily. If
clients are operating under financial constraints
then Narrowband Receiver, solutions which
have reduced channel coverage, are potential
alternatives although cell coverage will be
reduced.

•t•

The Decryptor unit can be shared or used by multiple Receivers.This allows for cost effective deployment,
for example a Decryptor could be stored in a secure area/control centre with a low bandwidth link to the
Receiver(s).

WIDEBAND PASSIVE INTERCEPTION
Wideband Passive interception: a passive interceptor based on a specific radio frontend that covers
the whole GSM radio spectrum. It automatically decodes and analyzes the signals exchanged off-the-air
on the GSM cells,The receiver is wideband, this means it can handle many more cells and simultaneous
communications than narrowband receivers.
The solution uses a Wideband receiver to perform Voice and SMS decoding in real-tirne.To reach this
performance it cannot manage the whole band simultaneously, the GSM traffic needs to be intelligently
filtered first, normally using Network Operator cells as the criteria.
Compared with Narrowband solutions the key benefits are:
• MASS interception regardless the number of cells
• Real-time performance
• Target priority management
• Exhaustive interception of signalization and SMS

• Portable solution

THESYSTEM
Theproduct is a passive wideband intercept system and, as described above, is a Tactical solution
specifically designed to intercept multiple Voice calls and SMS within an area, Typically used from a
vehicle, it can be easily transported to allow use within buildings, or sensitive locations, such as Borders

Narrowband Passive Interception: A passive
interceptor based on narrowband receivers,
essentially small radio units. Each radio unit is
dedicated to wait for a call departure on specific
frequencies (specific operator cell). When a call
(or SMS) starts, one of the radios is dedicated
to do the interception of this call. Narrowband
interceptors are typically 4, 8, 18 or 32 channel
devices where a 16 channel system following
4 cells simultaneously will have 4-channels
locked on the cell's main frequency, leaving 12
free channels to be allocated on any call start
(or SMS). This means the more channels which
are dedicated to specific cells then the less the
capability to simultaneously intercept a call or
SMS.

To handle 36 networks there is a 30 option addon system which can be integrated with the GSM
systern.This device will emulate a 30 network to
attract 30 mobiles and, for designated Targets,
selectively push them to GSM where they remain
unless they are rebooted or pushed back to 30 by
the GSM system.
Non-target phones are not affected and remain
in 30-mode.

The key features of this option are:
• Measures distance to all 30 phones with
accuracy of less than 30 m
• Selectively forces only designatedIargetts) to
GSM
• Selectively blocks communication of 36

• Automatically scans and detects parameters
of all 36 networks
• Detects all 3G phones and collects all their
identities (MASI, IMEI andIMS1)
• Displays phone model, country of origin and

OVERVIEW

BACKGROUND OVERVIEW

The cellular structure of GSM means all traffic is communicated from the Network through a Basestation
to Subscribers.This last step involves transmitting over the air, the weakness and, hence, attack point for
interception solutions.
Tosecure Networks, the Operator implements A5.1 encryption on the Traffic and encrypts each
communicationsession using a newly generated session key called the Kc.The ability to derive the Kc in
real-timeA5.1 is critical to decode each session, i.e. each Voice and SMS communication.
Themostcommonlyused method by decryptor is based on the 'Brute ForceAttack where:
• method is over 10 years old and a non-intelligent approach to derive Kc
• attack relies on receiving specific signaling messages (Plaintext)
• messages used are taken only from the Downlink
• statistical approach means there is no absolute time it takes to derive Kc
• signal strength or signal errors have a dramatic effect on system performance
• any variation in network implementation means it is not possible to get Kc
• requires lots of processing power making solutions large & power hungry
Although the weaknesses within GSM networks are well known it is only now Network Operators
are implementing the required security upgrades. The biggest change will be when Randomization, a
software upgrade, which reduces the available predictable plaintext, is introduced at end 2011/early
2012,Any changes in the Plaintext will have a catastrophic effect on the current generation of PASSIVE
Decryptors.

INTRODUCTION
The forthcoming introduction of Randomization as part of a suite of Security upgrades by Network
Operators in 2011 & 2012 will cause a major performance impact for the current generation decrypt
systems and, therefore, off-air passive solution s.
The only hope for Law Enforcement and Government Agencies is the emergence of next generation BB
technology from lvigneri, designed to handle these changes:
• state-of-the-art capability takes a new highly intelligent predictive approach
• implements clever Cryptographic shortcuts which do not rely on receiving specific messages or
plaintext
• uses both the a n d 1XL
• w e use the whole signahzation stream which significantly improves the real world performance
especially when signals are of mixed quality
• intelligent approach reduces the need for high power processing
• o u r solutions derive multiple Kc simultaneously
• solutions are extremely power efficient

The platform can be defined as having two distinct primary sub-systems, being:
Location Unit
This component comprises the platforms hardware and supporting software that enables the interface
to the Signaling System No.7 (SS7).
Location Suite
This component comprises the application software and the management tools with multi-language
support.
The scope and capabilities of the standard platform are summarized briefly as follows:
A) Location Unit (LU):
• The basic Location Unit includes:
• U p to 4 x SS7 Signaling links Time Slots) per unit
• U p to 20 location queries per second
• 10/100 Ethernet connectivity
• Software Interface to Location Suite
• A P I Interface for 3rd party applications
• S S 7 interface for location requests and location information provisioning over SS]
• White-list authorization feature for location queries

• Provisioning of raw location data (such as IMSI, MSC, LAC, Cell-ID, Subscriber Status, Location
Age)
• Integrated basic database functionality for information, such as Longitude/Latitude, MSC-/CellName etc
B) Location Suite (IS):
TheALTAMIDES Suite provides a role-based Single Sign-on mechanism, a method of access control that
allows users to login once, and gain access to multiple resources of software modules within the full
rangeALTAMIDES suite, dependent on the access rights (role) assigned by the respective ALTAMIDES
Administrator, without the need to enter multiple passwords, therefore, reducing the user administration
effort and reducing password fatigue.
Furthermore, the Location Suite is multi-language enabled. CLIENT can implement a default language
and each user of the system has the capability to configure their preferred language, if other languages
are configured in the system.
