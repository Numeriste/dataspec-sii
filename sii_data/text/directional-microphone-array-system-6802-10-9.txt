Directional Microphone Array System

MODEL 6802

Audio collection in large, open areas can often require pinpoint accuracy to isolate
specific audio sources. Only TSE 6802 can deliver the technology to electronically
steer multiple beams through a sound field collected by a fixed microphone array.
Key features of the TSE 6802 system:
• Provides a high-gain electronic beam steering capability
• Steers three separate beams from one set of microphones
• Supports a wide variety of custom microphone arrays, handling up to 96 microphones on 16 channels of input
• Features a unique stereo beam mode for a natural listening experience
• Offers hardware and software based steering controls for maximum flexibility
• 3-D beam forming (azimuth, elevation, and distance) available under software
control
• Can be used in real-time surveillance or post-processing of multi-track recordings
