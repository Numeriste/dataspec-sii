Virtualization In The DC: More Than a Trend
Virtualization deployment increasing year
over year in data centers.
Gartner: over 30% of x86 architecture
servers workloads running on VMs
Double digit annual growth
Virtualization
–  Great CAPEX improvements, no visibility.
–  Passive monitoring of Inter-Virtual Machine Traffic
is nonexistent.

Virtualization Creates
Security, Monitoring and
Compliance Risks
• 

No visibility into inter-VM traffic,
vulnerabilities or threats

• 

Lacks auditing of data passing
between virtual servers

• 

Inability to pinpoint resource
utilization issues
