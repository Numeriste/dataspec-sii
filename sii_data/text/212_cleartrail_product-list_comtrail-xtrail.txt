Off-The-Air Interception

In an increasingly complex communication world, with cellular devices having given communication a
paradigm shift, tactical monitoring of mobile communications can prove to be a challenge to the L W .
Though centralized GSM monitoring center does provide access to any mobile communication but
sometimes field operations are a need of the hour. In such situations, LEAS face encryption, large
number of GSM Operatdrs, rriultiple BTS and range of frequencies as cha1lenges.to tactical monitoring
of mobile communications.
The all-ned "mTraiL" is ClearTrail's answer to all these challenges. The new mTrait is now geared with
powerful technology that leaves no foot prints while intercepting communication. It's portable, easy to
deploy and makes it easierto interceptand analyze mobile communications.
