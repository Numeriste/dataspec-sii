Data. The Strategic Thuraya Monitoring System
is capable of providing both side of the
communication (full duplex call), call related
information along with the location of the
Thuraya Phone by monitoring of both L &
C-band. System is designed and integrated to
intercept Thuraya Communication from both
Thuraya-2 and Thuraya-3 Satellite.
Standard configuration of the system provides
monitoring of minimum 7 spot beams and 84
duplex calls simultaneously.
