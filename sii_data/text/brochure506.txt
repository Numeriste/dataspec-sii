Homeland security wireless
applications
The mobile phone has been a great
tool for bringing all of us closertogether for business and social
purposes. However, those who
oppose our way of life also use the
same mobile technology to stay
hidden whilst working against our
society. The challenge in homeland
security is to find the source of this
continually evolving threat amongst
ordinary, innocent civilians.
Cambridge Consultants has created
a reference design which enables
development of "pocket-sized"
wireless equipment for use by
government and police. Possible
uses in homeland security include
the following applications:

IMSI catcher
Portable base-station for secure
user group communications
Network traffic monitor for legal
intercept

Introducing Sidewinder

Customisation

Cambridge Consultants' Sidewinder
hardware reference design provides
a complete and low-costmanufacturable base-station
hardware design, suitable for smallcell 2G and 3G operation. Designed
for use as a small cellular basestation (femtocell), Sidewinder can
also be adapted to make similar
products for use in surveillance.

Sidewinder provides base-station
capability in its standard form.

Alternatively, Cambridge
Consultants can provide hardware
design customization services to
adapt the design for alternative
specifications, such as 3G network
monitoring, multi-band support,
increased transmit power, receiver
diversity or multiple channel support
(multi-transceiversupport).
Licensees of the reference design
receive all design information, such
that they can also make their own
modifications to extend the capability
of the hardware to meet their
specific needs.

Powerful DSP

Flexible radio subsystem

Onboard Linux environment

Sidewinder is based upon
Picochip's PC312 Femtocell
Baseband SOC.The PicoArray DSP
processor included in the baseband
device provides industry leading
DSP performance at low power
consumption.

Sidewinder makes use of the classleading Flexible radio device from
Lime Microsystems. This radio is
intrinsically highly flexible, and yet
provides excellent performance. It is
able to operate at any frequency
between 375MHz and 4GHz, and
supports programmable channel
bandwidths between 200kHz and
28MHz.

The Picochip PC312 SoC includes a
sophisticated ARM1 1 applications
processor sub-system running at
400MHz. This processor provides a
Linux environment under which
higher stack layers and application
software can run.

The PC312 DSP has optimized hard
functions to support the WCDMA
PHY and Lower-MAC reference
software available directly from
Picochip.
The PC312 has sufficient soft
programmable DSP resources to run
a sophisticated 2.75G PHY.
Cambridge Consultants' Centaur
software is the only GSM, GPRS
and EDGE PHY reference available
for Picochip hardware.

Sidewinder baseband can be
adapted to support software-switch
from 2G-GSM to 3G-WCDMA
operation.

Duplex filtering, required to prevent
the transmitter from "deafening" the
receiver, is included. Sidewinder
has been designed to support a
single set of band filters in any one
build, but the desired band of
operation can be selected at build
time through the use of appropriate
filter components. All necessary
channel filtering options required to
meet blocking requirements for both
GSM and WCDMA operation are
included within the base design and
do not need modification when
selecting band or GSM or WCDMA
standard.

Onboard frequency reference

Flexible engagement

Sidewinder has an on-board
frequency reference. This can be
accurately controlled by one of the
following techniques:

Cambridge Consultants has a
proven track record for delivering
breakthrough products for over 50
years. Our team of over 300

Monitoring of the background
network topology is achieved with a
downlink sniffer function which is a
standard part of the Centaur PHY
software, and can be added to a
custom developed 3G physical layer.
