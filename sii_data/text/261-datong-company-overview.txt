INTELLIGENCE BACKGROUND
The world's leading agencies continue to use Datang solutions for gathering
critical intelligence on an increasingly international scale.

Intelligence gathering techniques have constantly and rapidly
developed with the changing nature of terrorism and crime.
Our solutions have regularly been re-mastered to ensure that
their acquired intelligence is accurate, timely and
uncompromised.
Some specialised acquisition activities require custom
technology developments that can be trusted to deliver a
successful outcome. Our in-house R&D specialists are regularly
called upon to create these solutions for use in specific arenas.
We have the skills to build these solutions from scratch or.
more commonly, to utilise the core of our existing products
as the basis from which to develop a system that delivers
exactly what you require.
