GSM Monitoring System: FALCON C+

Description
The Falcon Monitoring System is a mobile application monitoring system used for
GSM networks and operates in the 900/1800MHz standard.
The Falcon allows the complete monitoring of the entire GSM data traffic, including
the monitoring of voice, SMS and fax traffic. All data will be automatically stored and
can be recalled selectively from the various data banks for further use.

The Falcon system fulfils the following main functions:
• Fully passive (non-detectable) off air interception of GSM communication in different
modes:
- Interception of communication in A5.1 protocols (Ki is necessary)
- Interception of communication in A5.2 protocols (real time A5.2 decoder is
integrated)
- Interception of communication in A5.0 protocols in real time
• Control of the Downlink (base station to mobile phone channel) and of the Uplink
(return channel from mobile phone to base station)
• Automatic coordination of the system, automatic channel search of the Base Station
Control Channels (BCCH) and registration of their parameters.
• Automatic registration and decoding of telephone conversations based on pre defined adjustable filter criteria and respective storage of these conversations on the
integrated 4 channel digital recorder.
• Automatic creation of an archive for recorded telephone conversations with sorting
to the subscribers monitored.
• Automatic registration and storage of all available protocols in the GSM network of
the monitored base station
• Control of 8 receivers (4 duplex receivers) for the automatic monitoring and recording of max. 4 telephone conversations
• Switching on and off for recording of conversations, text messages (SMS) as well as
data transmission (fax messages). The fax messages are stored in a Hexadecimal
protocol
• Display of Operating Mode of the 4 Duplex receivers and the activated filter function on the display of the computer
