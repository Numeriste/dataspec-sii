CASPER-T – WI-FI NETWORK INTERCEPTION

STANDARD FEATURES

The CASPER-T system is specifically
dedicated to the Wifi network
interception. It has two different
working modes: TAP interception
of a targeted Wifi network, or local
pcap recorder. When used as a Wifi
TAP, CASPER-T output can be
processed in SMINT or DUMB-0
products.

CASPER-T is a high end monitoring
appliance from AMESYS Company.
The CASPER-T system has
superior interception and processing
capacity in a small form factor
product.
