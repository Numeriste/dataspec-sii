Equipping Audio Forensic Laboratory
Depending on the volume of collected audio materials, a forensic au<;lio laboratory can be
flexibly configured to meet the needs of any organization.
The typical mid-size laboratory can support all basic audio examinations challenges with
two workstations.
The following considerations should be taken into account:
Audio forensic science stands at the junction of diverse disciplines including physics, audio
engineering, linguistics, and law. Since it can be quite a challenge for one specialist to
master equally all this information, normally at least two analysts are involved in a case
investigation. They are one audio engineer and a l~mguage specialist. Their parallel and
independent work can significantly increase reliability of the conclusion.
