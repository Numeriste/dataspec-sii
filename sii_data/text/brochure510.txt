Private VoIP Exchanges & the IAX Dilemma
Explosive Growth of I A X Protocol and International E I P Tmnking Leaves Industry Unprepared
In June of 2009, Packet Forensics undertook a
comprehensive research effort with the help of one
of our partners, a global telecommunications service
provider. Their network represents a large crosssection of the greater North American IP backbone
because they are a tier1 Internet service provider, or
to what people commonly refer as a carrier's carrier.
Amongst a larger agenda, we sought to unearth
quantitative details related to actual VoIP protocol
usage-what are people using to transport VoIP
traffic and are they trunking to several large carriers
or is there a preponderance of peertopeer traffic or
interconnectivitybetween PBXs and providers.
What we found not only surprised us, but warranted
immediate action on our part to fill gaps in our
product portfolio and to inform our current
customers who rely upon us for passive VoIP
monitoring and interception.
In order to preserve subscriber privacy, deep
packet inspection (DPI) was used only to positively
identify protocols and because of privacy sensitivity,
we did not determine if calls were being executed
independently or trunked. Trafficflow records were
analyzed to identify statistically significant networks
of call origination and termination and to get a
sense of which protocols were being used in which
telephony situations.
The high level results of the analysis provided
unexpected answers and insight. First, MGCP is still
used across the public Internet, not only within
enterprises. Second, H.323 remains the heavy-lifter
for teleconferencing. Finally InterAsterisk
Exchange (IAX) protocol now comprises a doubledigit percentage of VoIl? This is particularly
interesting when you consider IAX traffic
occupies only one stream for potentially
dozens of calls when trunking. Consider
also that although IAX is an open
standard, the vast majority of telephony
platforms implementing IAX are non-

commercial, public domain applications that don't
include facilities for active interception capability
This means L4X ttafficmust be ca~turedbassivel~and
doing so requires systems like ours. The speed of
IAX adoption is nothing short of amazing. IAX is
very different from most VoIP protocols, but its
unique characteristics likely drove its adoption.
First, it's a binary protocol as opposed to text-based.
Second, it doesn't use RTP to carry call content.
Instead, it offers a novel approach that aggregates
into one stream making
both content and si@g
it NATfiendl~ and
more efficientthan RTP
with two thirds less overhead per packet.
Suffice it to say, much of our engineering time
late last year was spent in support of
VIGCP and IAX development and we're
proud to say that we're now the first and
only passive capture solution for IAX. We
even support IAX's optional trunking
coniigurations. It's been a busy quarter around
here and a productive one for our customers.
