Tracking GPS mod. P-10 is a highly integrated device dedicated to the environmental silent monitoring and GPS tracking.
Fed to batteries it can catch up an autonomy of beyond three months maintaining a degree of reliability to the maximum
levels. Planned taking advantage itself of the last technologies, the mod. does not fear comparison with similar equipment,
thanks to its smart dimensions and high sensibility. The voice section has two separate fully programmable audio path in
terms of volume using SMS or simply by a DTMF keypad (for example you may use the same telephone making the call).
It may be battery operated or directly connected to the same vehicle supply.
The P-10 operations may be triggered by the operator (SMS/DTMF) or automatically when any movement has been detected.
The device is designed to operate with two external microphones (Ø 2.5 mm) connected by a very resistant cable (len:
1.5 m or more on request). The GSM and GPS antennas are connected via SMA RF connectors.
The P-10 can store up to 113500 GPS log positions in internal memory.
It’s possible to download all the stored position with a GSM data call starting from a specified date/hour.
Digital input and output make possible to integrate the mod. P-10 with external devices.
Audio Output offers the possibility to command an external device with DTMF command.
Finally, the enclosure – made in aluminium, passivated – offers adequate protection against dust, water and withstands
to most of other environmental conditions.
GSM Specification:
Features:
The GSM section performs a set of telecom services (TS) according to GSM standard
phase 2+, ETSI and ITU-T. it is compliant with GSM phase 2/2+
The functions of the module are implemented by issuing Hayes AT commands as detailed
in GSM specs level 07.05/07.07
SMS are sent and received accordingly to MO/MT, GSM07.05, PDU and text mode.
Data is transferred at 9600 bps (CSD)
GPRS is a multislot Class 10, mobile station protocol class B.
