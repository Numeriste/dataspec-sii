High Performance GPS Logistics Tracking for
Trailers, Containers, Vehicles and Remote Assets
Ocellus TlOO is a High Sensitivity GPS/
GPRS logistics, fleet management and
tracking product, suitable for tracking
trailers, vehicles, containers and other
remote assets. High Sensitivity GPS
enables TlOO to be installed without
external antennas, e.g. under a vehicle in
a convenient location for the installer, e.g.
adjacent to a junction box.
Ocellus TlOO is designed to be powered
by the vehicle to which it is connected.
If installed on an aticulated trailer for
example, the TlOO internal battery
continually charges while the tractor
unit is connected; when the trailer is
disconnected from power the unit detects
this and switches to a power-saving mode
to extend its battery life.
The unit detects its motion state and
determines journey start / stop and
movement, enabling the automated
generation of management reports from
web tracking services.
The rugged enclosure and connector
system, integrated antennas and
rechargeable battery make Ocellus
TlOO easy and inexpensive to install and
highly reliable by removing the need
for a complex wiring installation, or
replacement of batteries.

Applications
Logistics and Fleet Management - easy to
install on vehicles, trailers and containers.
Designed for tracking in difFicult
environments.
