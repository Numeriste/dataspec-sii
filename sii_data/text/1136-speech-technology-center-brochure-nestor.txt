NESTOR
Distributed Speech Transcription System
Applications
Nestor is a Network based distributed transcription
and documenting system, designed to make
transcription faster, more efficient giving better
quality. It provides automated workflow to multiple
transcriptionists for fast documenting of large
volume of speech. Nestor is applied in:
u Parliaments and Congress halls

Functional Overview
Sound recorded by sound stations and stored on
sound server is distributed by editor or administrator in
pieces between operators. Each operator type in
transcription of one sound fragment. All fragments of
sound and text are connected in a whole document
with time marks allowing the checking of transcription
quality. The whole text with sound is available at the
editorâ€™s workstation to check and correct. All the
workflow is automatically controlled by system and
managed from administrator/supervisor workstation.

Faster Transcription
Nestor helps to organize the work of the operators
in the most rational way, so that even small team of
typists can cope with large amounts of the speech
data. Typists type in transcription using special text
editor enabled with speech playback speed
variability.
System Scalability
The system is designed to meet requirements of
documentation service in full. The system is fully
scalable for large institutions.

Playback speed changing
This feature allows operator to choose the
playback speed (using hotkeys) corresponding to
speed of typing. When the speech is played at
changed speed, it remains natural and intelligible.
Combined text editor and wave player
For text input Nestor uses specially designed text
editor with wave player functions. When operators
input the text, they can control the playback to
rewind, to loop the sound and to change the speed
of playback. And of course text editor is enabled
with spell checker, macros and formatting.
Text linked to sound
An important feature of this editor is that text is
automatically linked to the sound, making it very
easy to find the speech corresponding to the
certain fragment of text.
Why Nestor is useful?
It allows to obtain full text transcription of an event
(conference, speech, talks, etc.) in few minutes.
Tens of speeches in parallel can be processed by
operators of the system at the same time.
