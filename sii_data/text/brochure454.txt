ASlS - Feature rich capabilities:
ASlS provides services comparable t o existing Automatic
Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS):
Collecting voice biometrics information o f known
or unknown suspects and related details (e.g.
name/group) o n a central database;
Comparing 'field' samples (e.g. intercepted calls) o f
an unknown individual against voice biometric models
stored in the central database (or a sub-unit o f it by
applying criteria such as Gender or Language): 1 t o M
identification.
The identification results consist o f a list o f possible
candidates with matching scores (ranked from highest t o
lowest probability t o show that the audio test belongs t o
the suspect), thus providing support f o r further
investigations.

ASlS has been designed t o cater f o r different customers'

requirements (small t o large deployments). ASlS takes
advantages o f client-sewer architecture: deployment
cost reduced, n o disk space needed on the client's PC,
data stored o n t h e server with far greater security
controls, control access and resources guaranteed, etc.
ASlS uses ACNITlO's proprietary and pioneering voice
biometrics technology (text independent, channel
independent and language independent) based o n
unique information extracted from an individual's vocal
tract, thus obtaining a high level o f accuracy and
reliability.

ASISpsweb-based interface is
intuitive, scalable and can be integrated
into a multi-modal platform including
complementary biometrics to increase
identification accuracy
