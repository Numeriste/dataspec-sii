BATVOX is an expert 1:i

voice biometric tool
designed f o r forensics experts and scientific police
t o perform speaker verification
and compile expert reports as evidence in court

BATVOX - Feature rich capabilities:
Case management
BATVOX allows organizing audios and voice models
by cases and sessions in which one or several calculations
can be run, thus facilitating the investigation.
Speaker ldentification
BATVOX allows either identification of unknown
voices against voices coming from known speakers or
verification of the identity o f a speaker making
comparisons 1 t o 1 (regardless of language and type of
speech).
BATVOX provides detailed speaker verifications with
Likelihood Ratios (LR) using the Bayesian Approach (as
f o r DNA analysis). The LR gives a robust estimation of the
verification task, in a probabilistic way, which can be
easily presented and justified in legal processes, always
with the support of an expert.
The calculation process can be exported t o an html file
t o be presented in court.
BATVOX, 2 solutions:

BATVOX Functions:
I) Cases management
Speaker ldentification (SID)
Compiling expert reports

BATVOX Use cases:
Forensic laboratories: world class expert tool
f o r identifying unknown voice samples against
recorded voices o f known suspects

Benefits:

*

Allows users t o have an additional biometric tool

surpassing
and challenging traditional barriers across any

t o petform speaker verification thus
telephony channel and any language

Increases strength o f the final result by
combining automatic speaker identification with
classical phonetic-acoustic method ('hybrid approach')

- BATVOX Basic: a single-user standalone solution for

Certainty of identification within a closed list

forensic experts based on a single machine;
- BATVOX Pro: a multi-user and distributed solution

o f suspects t o pursue case investigation, providing the
precision and reliability required in court hearings

Client-Server ideally suited f o r larger organizations and
laboratories, managing a central database, interconnected with users' Client PCs through a local network.
BATVOX uses AGNITlO's proprietary and pioneering voice
biometrics technology (text independent, channel
independent and language independent) based on
unique information extracted f r o m an individual's vocal
tract, thus obtaining a high level o f accuracy and
reliability.

BATVOX is an expert forensic tool,
fast, transparent and easy to use
A complete solution to give full support
to specialists' investigation work

BATVOX - Key competitive advantages:
PerforlIlance

is much higher in real forensic
environments than f o r fingerprints. For some specific
tasks, t h e performance o f an automatic system can
even be far superior t o the petformance o f human
listeners
