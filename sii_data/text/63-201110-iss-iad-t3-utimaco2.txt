SMS, the forgotten Source of Intelligence
 3 billion users worldwide are sending 3 SMS per day in average

(3.285.000.000.000 / year).
 Mass Monitoring and Content Retention of SMS/MMS traffic is

definitely a source of intelligence disregarded by many.
 This session gives insight in the ways of intelligence gathering in this

massive amount of data.
Updated figures on Feb 2011, worldwide:
 SMS: estimated 3,300,000,000,000
(https://scholar.sun.ac.za/bitstream/handle/10019.1/962/de villiers_case study_2010.pdf)

 Emails: average of 3,250,000 per second, approx. 85% SPAM

Quick Recap
SMS
Messages are sent to the SMSC which provides a "store and forward" mechanism. It
attempts to send messages to the SMSC's recipients. If a recipient is not reachable, the
SMSC q
queues the message
g for later retry
y ((a "forward and forget"
g option
p
exists also).
)
Short messages can be encoded using a variety of alphabets: the default is GSM 7-bit,
8-bit encoding, UTF-16 encoding are other options Depending on which alphabet the
subscriber has configured in the handset
handset, the maximum short message sizes of 160 7
7-bit
bit
characters, 140 8-bit characters, or 70 16-bit characters (including spaces). Characters
in languages such as Arabic, Chinese, Korean, Japanese or Cyrillic alphabet languages
(e.g. Russian, Serbian, Bulgarian, etc.) must be encoded using UTF-16.
Concatenated SMS can be sent using multiple messages, in which case each message
will start with a user data header (UDH) containing segmentation information. UDH is
part of the payload.
payload The receiving handset is then responsible for reassembling the
message and presenting it to the user as one long message. Theory permits up to 255
segments, 6 to 8 segment messages are the practical maximum.

Quick Recap
Intelligence
“Intelligence” has been defined in many ways within the LI and Investigations
arena and sometimes “ Information” is misleadingly understood as
intelligence.
g
For us “Intelligence”
g
is the extra that comes with information,,
something of added value explaining what that information may mean. Or in
other words the step from knowing only facts to having insight into the context
existing among them.

Summary
Sun Tzu, “The Art of War”
 “If you know neither yourself nor the enemy, you are a fool and will

battle ”
meet defeat in every battle.
Not knowing anything, is desperate
 “If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory you will

suffer a defeat.”
Of course you need to know about your capabilities and limits; those of
tools
yyour officers and your
y
 “If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the

results of a hundred battles.”
This is the task in front,
front know your enemy
