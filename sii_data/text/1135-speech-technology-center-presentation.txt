Operational Procedures
All incoming recordings are
automatically cut into fragments of
a given duration, then evenly
distributed among the operators,
who transcribe the speech
fragments for text production.
The editor’s workstation then
combines the separate text
segments from various operators
into the whole document, which
can be saved or printed out

The main goal of Nestor is to receive the full text of
speech in several minutes after it is finished and
with absolutely perfect quality.

Documentation Speed
A group of five skilled
Operators can handle
transcription of one speech
event (meeting, lecture, etc.)
To manage three events
simultaneously, three groups
of Operators, i.e. 15 people
are necessary.

Comfort features
Operator’s software set of
features to transcribe effectively:
"Variable playback speed
"Use of Hotkeys
"Tone correction
"Loop playback

Data protection
Only the Administrator and the
Editors have access to the full
sound recordings plus texts and
are allowed to edit and modify
them.
Operators work with short,
separate speech fragments that
can not be linked together. Thus
the Operators will not know the
contents of the whole event or
tamper with the source audio or
text.

Data transmission

The system is distributed over
TCP/IP LAN
