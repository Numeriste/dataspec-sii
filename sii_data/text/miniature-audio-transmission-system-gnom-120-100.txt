Miniature Audio Transmission System – GNOM
Description

GNOM is an audio transmission system providing super-broad Spread Spectrum Modulation. Due to
its transmission band width of more than 40 MHz and the noise-similar spectrum, the detection of the
audio transmitter is extremely difficult. Due to the modulation process interception without a special
decoder is very difficult. Its enormous low power consumption of approx. 1 mA enables excellent
long-term audio monitoring operations. With a 9 V-battery operating times of more than 60 days can
be reached!
