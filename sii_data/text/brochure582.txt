Lawful lnterception (LI) solution vendors require
the capability to see inside protocols and
IP-based applications used by subscribers in
many functions of a system including:

Benefits:
lnterception of all services operated by
Telcos (VolP, email) and over-the-top services
(webmails, Instant Messaging, etc.)
ldentification of users on any IP-based
application ID (login, address, etc.)

In the Monitoring Center

Qosmos expertise in real-time parsing of all

Support interception at very high
throughputs: monitoring of 20 Gbps per
probe, up to 160 000 sessions intercepted
simultaneously

Case Study of LI Solution Embedding Qosmos Technology
Overview
Interception system for a whole country
Monitoring of 550 Gbps in real time
Qosmos ixMachine LI Edition at the
interception point for IP traffic
Qosmos ixEngine used in H13 filtering and
in a monitoring center developed by a LI
solution vendor

1) lnterception with ixMachine LI
Edition
21 X ixMachine LI Edition 10 031 probes with
4 X l0 GE links each
Each probe monitors up to 20 Gbps of
traffic and intercepts 120 000 simultaneous

This reduces the number of packets
processed and stored by the monitoring
center by 90%
instant upgrade of the monitoring center
capability from 100 simultaneous targets to
900 users while keeping the same hardware

3) ixEngine in the Monitoring
Center
ixEngine embedded in the Monitoring
Center accepts Ethernet, IP and H13 formats

ixEngine parses the flows in real-time to
extract metadata and content for

- Standardized protocols: email sender,
receiver, messaoe text, VolP caller and
callee. etc

sessions
Unlimited number of interception rules

47 X ixMachine LI Edition 1041 with 8 X l GE

Monitoring Center

links
Each probe monitors up to 5 Gbps of traffic
and intercepts 60 000 simultaneous sessions

2) H13 Filtering with ixEngine
H13 filtering device embedding Qosmos
ixEngine developed by a LI solution vendor

ixEngine accepts H13 packets, parses H13
flows in real-time to identify applications
(email, webmail, video streaming, etc.)
Based on the application identification
provided by Qosmos ixEngine, the H13 filter
selects only relevant packets (e.g. IPTV, ads
and Youtube packets are discarded) and
forwards them t o the Monitoring Center
