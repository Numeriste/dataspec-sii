Cell-Seeker
Network Mapping System
Cell-Seeker is the essential tool to independently
monitor or map multiple mobile networks. By
continuously scanning all available networks and
recording the GPS position an RF 'Finger Print' of
the environment is recorded.
The Digital RF Cell-Seeker Network Monitoring
System is able to monitor and report on up to 8
networks simultaneously from each mini rack

Cell-Seeker
System

The mini rack system can be used on the move in
a vehicle, or permanently installed in a building .
Fast scanning techniques enable Cell-Seeker to
provide detailed data on the nearest cells for each
network every 5 seconds.

Features
• Fully portable
•Monitoring 8 Networks simultaneously from each rack.
• Reporting on the multiple cells for each network.
• Fast response scanning time less than 5 seconds
•Multi-band operation 8501900118001190012100
•Standards: GSM, DCS, PCS, WCDMA,GPRS, UMTS.
•Data is automatically stored securely for analysis.
•Location of Assets and I or Staff using the PV900 Tracker

Applications - Monitoring and/or Mapping of Mobile Networks.

Cell-Seeker
Network Mapping System
Locating with the PV900
Digital RF have combined the GSM Tracking technology of the
PV900 and Cell-Seeker to enable the accurate location of
devices, staff or assets inside a building or externally.
The PV900 uses a unique algorithm to report on all aspects of
the cellular environment. The data is transmitted back to the
control centre via SMS or GPRS. Upon receipt the location of
the device is found through analysis of the database collected by
Cell-Seeker.

PV900 Tracking Device

Where there is no data from Cell-Seeker, for example during international travel, Location
Based Services are used to get an approximate location which can provide accuracy of
500m - 4Km. Once the approximate location is known then a survey is conducted in the
region using Cell-Seeker. Upon analysis of the newly collected data the information from the
PV900 tracking device can be checked again and accuracy is increased leading through an
iterative process to the target being found.
The Cell-Seeker system and locating software is fully portable to be used in a pursuit vehicle.
No special training is required other than operating a simple user interface.
