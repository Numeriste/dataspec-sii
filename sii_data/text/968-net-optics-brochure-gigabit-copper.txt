GigaBit Copper Tap
Get total traffic visibility for monitoring and security devices by placing Net Optics GigaBit
Copper Taps on critical network links. GigaBit Copper Taps support passive monitoring of
GigaBit links at speeds at 1000 Mbps.

Operating Specifications:

Operating Temperature: 0ºC to 55ºC

For superior reliability, the GigaBit Copper Tap features Link Fault Signaling which gives the
devices connected to the Tap critical information about link status. If either side of the
bi-directional link fails, the Tap immediately communicates the fault to both devices.

Storage Temperature: -10ºC to 70ºC

The GibaBit Copper Taps establish permanent passive access ports without introducing a
point of failure or disturbing other network connections. Without an IP address, monitoring
devices are isolated from the network, dramatically reducing their exposure to attacks.
However, the monitoring device connected to the Tap still sees all full-duplex traffic, including
Layer 1 and Layer 2 errors.

Power Supply:

For extra uptime protection, Net Optics GigaBit Copper Taps offer redundant power
connections. Should the primary power source fail, the Tap automatically switches to the
backup power source.

Copper Cable Type:

All network and monitoring cables necessary for plug-and-play deployment are
included.
