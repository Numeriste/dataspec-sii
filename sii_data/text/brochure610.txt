Multiband Manpack
The WAVpac is part of Linkabit’s next generation family of high performance tactical radios.
Designed to provide reliable high quality voice and data communications over the full 1.6 to
108 MHz frequency band, the WAVpac is a true multiband radio system.
In addition to its extensive HF capabilities, the radio’s extended frequency range allows
replacement of dual HF and VHF radio systems with a single radio. The WAVpac is a software
defined radio featuring a DSP-based design and incorporating key features that include
advanced data waveforms, digital voice, ALE, GPS, ECCM and encryption.
The WAVpac is available as a 20W manpack, or as the core of 150W vehicular or base station system. Engineered for reliable operation in extremely harsh situations, the WAVpac is a
rugged, completely immersible unit that meets the demanding environmental specifications of
MIL-STD-810F.
Using its embedded GPS receiver, accurate position location and time-of-day capability is a
standard feature of the WAVpac. Automatic Link Establishment (ALE) compliant to
MIL-STD-188-141B is also standard and provides automatic "best channel" selection.
Multiple data waveforms, including MIL-STD-188-110B serial tone and Appendix C
(QAM) and STANAG 4415, allow high-speed and robust data transfer. Wideband FSK is
available to provide 16 kbps data transfer in the VHF frequency band.
Digital Voice is possible through
the implementation of a multi-rate
STANAG 4591 (MELPe) vocoder and
16 kbps CVSD. Frequency hopping and
AES encryption options offer a high
level of jamming resistance and transmission security for both digital voice
and data communications.
In order to host the most desirable
waveforms available today and ensure
ease of future upgrades, the WAVpac is
a DSP based software defined radio. In
addition, the WAVpac design also
incorporates a state of the art Wide-band
Digital Front End for future expandability and maximum flexibility. The
WAVpac design translates to higher performance, lower weight, longer battery
life and smaller size, allowing for
extended operations with enhanced
capabilities.
