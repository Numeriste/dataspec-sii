For many years Evidential Recording has been carried out using dual-deck analogue recorders
and cassettes, these systems are coming to the end of their practical life — the technology has
been superseded by versatile digital alternatives offering synergistic applications, all of which
can be either standalone or fully integrated.
The 0

T h e B e n e f i t s of Digital Solutions.

> The technology is becoming obsolete.
> The recorders are ageing, causing increasing downtime.
> Spares & media are becoming increasingly difficult to obtain.
> Service costs are increasing disproportionately.
> Storage & retrieval costs are high.
> Special transcription equipment is required -with attendant costs.

> High quality - proven technologies.
> Enhanced performance and reliability
> Lower operational costs.
> Rapid return on investment
> Customised business processes
> Facilitates fully integrated solutions.

Defining your needs
One Digital Limited has developed a simple and unique process for developing customised solutions
which are cost-effective and 'fit-for-purpose' for individual clients through a real understanding of their
business processes and management systems.
> A detailed analysis of working practices &
mandatory procedures.

> Reliable & robust integration with the core IT
infrastructure.

> An analysis of procedural conformity with specific
applications.
> The provision of 'in—built' security of data & information.

> The specification of correct Content Management
solutions commensurate with the volumes and
types of data.

Improving your Business Processes
Maximum efficiency can be achieved through the introduction of Integrated Workflow Management
solutions, This efficiency is the result of the planned integration of all, or any of the synergistic
applications, via a central, open-architecture, digital network with a standard SQL database.
