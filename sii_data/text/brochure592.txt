Todays publishers must be able to convert their most valuable resourcecontentinto useful, easy to find
information and use it to develop other revenue generating formats. Semantic technology, through its ability
to understand the meaning of words, and the relationships between concepts included in sentences, paragraphs
and entire documents, offers a more effective way to search large amounts of informationstructured or
unstructuredand manage and organize it automatically.
Expert Systems COGITO® semantic platform applies semantic technology to content, enriching documents,
content management systems and web pages with semantic information and metadata, and enabling
knowledge management capabilities, greater searchability and less manual intervention, all benefits for
publishers. Cogito makes it possible for publishers to create innovative online products by introducing new
capabilities in semantic advertising, social media integration and mobile delivery.

Cogito automatically links similar content and
suggests useful links for navigation.

Increased revenue.
Cogito enables the automatic identification and ranking of related
content, which can be used to suggest content to readers and
guide navigation, increasing page views and time on your site.
Unparalleled search performance.
Automatic semantic analysis provides users with a totally new
search experience. Content can be filtered to drill down within
a set of search results and retrieve the most semantically relevant
information.
Cogito automatically categorizes content, extracting concepts
and entities (people, organizations, locations, addresses, etc.),
which is used to create links and improve search and usability
of information, and enables new ways to use and generate revenue
from content.
Higher productivity and reduced production costs.
Automatic tagging, categorization and identification of content
leaves editors free to focus on other tasks and ensures greater
consistency and accuracy.
Innovation through mobile delivery features.
Cogito gives publishers the foundation for delivery to mobile
devices, enabling even more semantic features for content and
data integration.

For more than 10 years, Expert System has supplied some of the worlds major media companies with
semantic publishing solutions.
AGI is a leading news agency with 16 bureaus around Italy and a consolidated presence
around the world.
AGI required greater efficiency in the compilation and categorization of its content and
wanted to improve the overall user experience on its website, while reducing operating
costs and guaranteeing a high level of precision based on IPTC standards.
Through the implementation of Cogito, AGI transformed news categorization and extraction into an automatic
process, allowing content to be more easily retrieved during search. By eliminating the manual aspects of
tagging it also introduced efficiencies in the organization of content. Semantic tagging automatically identifies
the most relevant content and specifies information used for analysis, extraction and key data. As a result,
AGIs users benefit from more accurate and easier web navigation and from automatically linked information.
Utilizing the Expert System semantic platform, we have reached a new and important frontier of technology.
Daniela Viglione, president and CEO, AGI
