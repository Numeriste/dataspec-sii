The Thor System is a full-featured, easy to use, portable digital
audio listeningand recordingsystem for use in surveillance
operations.
The audio signal is digitally encrypted t o prevent third-party
interception.The range is typically over 500 meters Ione third
of a mile, and can be increased with a high power repeater.
The transmitters feature a low power, non-transmit "sleep"
mode that is controlled by a key fob remote controller or by the
receiver.

Thor - in brief
Flexible kit configuratia
The basic components of the Thor System consists of a
handheld receiver with built-in solid state recorder and four
small digital stereo transmitters for easy set-up In a variety of
mission critical applications.
The Thor System includes everything required such as
microphones, power supplies, batteries, antennas, and cables to
deploy a stealthy, dependable surveillance solution.
Simple to use
The Thor System is very easy to use for both novice and
advanced users. The intuitive control 1 keypad of the receiver
allow a new user t o monitor and record stereo audio in high
quality within seconds. For the advanced user. the wide
range of options allow flexible and sophisticated system
configuration.

High audio quality
The Thor System is characterized by its outstanding high audio
quality and a stable RF link which is achieved by use of a two
antenna diversity reception technique combined with error
correction algorithms. The audio quality is designed for high
intelligibility of speech and thus the audio samplingfrequency
and audio frequency response is 2.5 times higher than in
most digital voice tranmitters Irecorders. The built-in AGC
(Automatic Gain Control) adapts the microphone amplification
to the sound level, and thereby achieves a wide dynamic range
even under the most extreme conditions.

Various communication links
For long distance monitoring, Thor prov~desvarious repeater
links, such as RF, Ethernet and GSM. The repeater mode extends
the operating range andlor allows decreasedtransmitter power
and an extension of the battery life.

. . .? audio signal is digitally encrypted to prevent third-party
interception. Furthermore, the receiver, the transmitters and
the RF repeater incorporate an adjustable RF output power to
help reduce the possibility of detection. For officer safety, the
Thor GM Key Fob remote control has a built-in panic button,
which. when activated, will send a panic alert to all listening
receivers. For higher operational security and performance, the
receiver has a built-in remote control for controlling various
transmitter settings and functions.

Data collection and filing
The built-in solid state recorder allows for 28 hours of
uncompressed, stereo audio recordings without a monitoring
team. and provides a backup document in case of transmission
failure. Each recording is time stamped and a digital watermark
is made of all the audio data. This means that all recordings
have their own unique watermark and are tamper proof.
