The user will administer targets for infection by entering the appropriate target data via the easy to use
GUI on the Management Workstation.The Management Server will distribute the necessary commands
to the FinFly ISP RADIUS Probes and Infection Proxies deployed in ISP's network.
ATarget is added to the Finny ISP system using its access data like "dial-in phone no" or "username
In case the target has a fixed IP-Address this IP-Address will be entered into the system. In this specific
case the RADIUS Probes are not involved in theTarget Identification process.

MONITORING SOLUTIONS
u-onit uL iNTERCEPTiuiv
Lawful Interception (LI) is the legally approved
surveillance o f telecommunication services,
and has become an important tool for law
enforcement agencies (LEAs) around the world for
investigating and prosecuting criminal activities
and terrorism. Most countries have passed laws
that require telecommunication service providers
to support LEAs with duly authorized requests to
identify, monitor, and deliver all of the electronic
communications o f specified individuals and
groups. While regulations and requirements
vary from country to country, international and
USAmerican standardization bodies like ETSI
or ANSI have developed technical standards for
LI that will facilitate the work of LEAs and help
operators and service providers to minimize their
costs. Although various standards for LI use
different terminology, the basic functional model
shown in figure 1 applies to all LI standards and
to all network and service types.

1
1
1

The main functions of any LI solution are to
access Interception-Related Information (IRI)
and Content of Communication (CC) from the
telecommunications network and to deliver the
information in a standardized format via the
handover interface to one or more monitoring
centers of law enforcement agencies. Of course,
before surveillance can take place, interception
requests must be approved and appropriately
provisioned to the Interception Access Points
within the service provider's network, and they
must be carefully and accurately terminated after
the interception authorization expires. In addition,
high security requirements for LI systems are
essential to prevent possible manipulation and
misuse.

Data Retention System refers to the process of storing call detail records and subscriber data for various
telecommunication services for a period of several months and years. Law enforcement agencies and
intelligence services regard the access to retained telecom data as an important pillar of criminal
investigation and the prevention of terrorism. The common objective is to use the data to identify and
trace suspects, uncover social networks among terrorists, or to collect admissible evidence for court
proceedings.

of interest; a single Remote System could double
the area o f coverage. Designed for maximum
portability and rapid deployment, the Remote
System is encased in a ruggedized, modular
casing which can be broken down into 4 individual
components for safe transportation.The portable
design enables the system to be easily relocated
in response to changing targets and areas of
interest. Users can assemble the system and it
can be fully operational in 30 minutes.

PASSIVEA-INTERFACE MONITORING FOR GSM NETWORKS,
PASSIVE MONITORING OF Er'RE GSM NETWORK
The A interface between the MSC (Mobile Switching Center) and BSC (Base•Station Controller) consists
of El or STM-1 trunks.The System solution monitorsTDM.
A-Interface links between BSCs and a MSC. It detects calls and text messages on these links and
captures IRI and uncompressed 13.711 A-Law or p-Law audio associated with the intercepts. Monitoring
of A-Interfaces may be implemented with PDH (64 duplex El) or SDI-I gateways (2 x STM-I). In the future
we will also support direct Ethernet interfaces. A deployment unit may be used to monitor more than one
A-Interface and a number of SS7 links at the same time. The A-Interface solution assumes thatTMSIs
are also unique within the context of a Location Area Code (LAC) and that the LACs are unique with
the context of the PLMN identity. In cases wflereIMSts are not unique, different name spaces can be
configured. It may not be necessary to monitor all links between an MSC and its sub-tended BSCs.
The A-Interface monitoring solution is illustrated in the following diagram.

With the A-Interface Monitoring System either specific GSM-cells can be monitored or an entire GSM
network, The system works completely passive and provides mass-storage capabilities and powerful
analysis tools for post processing of huge amount of data.

RELESS LOCA'
WLS is the only technology that provides high-accuracy mobile location, across all types of environments,
in a highly scalable and cost-effective way. The easy-to-deploy, easy-to-manage solution provides LI
applications with the precise location of mobile devices to accuracy within 50 meters, and gives Law
Enforcement Agencies 1LEAs) real-time, post-event, geo-fenced and even predictive intelligence using
mass Location capabilities.
The Wireless Locator has the following applications:

Target-based Location Interception
Adding high-accuracy location information t o
target-based interception allows LEAs to monitor
fleeing suspects in real time and track a historical
"bread-crumb trail" of the wireless activity of a
specific user. The highly-accurate WLS solution
can pinpoint the location of mobile devices to the
, exact building.

Mass Location Interception
WLS is the only location technology that enables
accurate mass location of all devices on a mobile
network. Mass location is especially helpful for
post-event analytics based on historical archived
data, identifying all wireless activity in an area
over a set period of time•This gives LEAs critical
investigative information about suspects after an
event - such as a bomb going off - including who
was present, who they were talking to and what
they did in the immediate afteftrathr

Border-zone Location Interception
Border-zone location interception allows a n
electronic virtual fence to be set up around a high
security area or an international border, allowing
LEAs to track the location of wireless devices that
travel in and out of the area.The accuracy of the
WLS solution ensures that precise locations are
identified along the border zone, preventing even
marginal incursions.

36 Blind Call is a new software feature for the
36N UMTS system. It allows 36 phones to be
locked to the 3GN and placed in a UMTS blind/
silent call for tracking purposes. This is the only
Way to establish blind calls to phones that are set
in "36 only" mode, and it removes the reliance on
passing the 36 phone to a GSM system fortracking
- the target phone stays on 36 frequencies at all
times.The 36-OF can detect and track the signal
from a 36 phone in a blind call, allowing the OF
operator to locate it.
Blind Call Features:
• N e w Acquisition mode for the 36N and OF target status for 36 phones makes operation simple
• Multiple 36 blind calls can be supported by each 3GN Node B
• Automatic 36 power control ensures that Node B and phone TX power are continually adjusted to
optimal levels to maintain the blind call
• T h e 36N can continue to take registrations from other 36 phones whilst maintaining a blind call to
the target phone
36 Direction Finder Features:
• Provides indication of target RSCP (Received Signal Code Power) to enable operator to judge
distance and bearing to target
• Features graphical and audio feedback of current target RSCP level for ease of use in challenging
operational scenarios
• Quick and simple to use with minimal configuration required

The 30N captures the 30 phone
and places it into a blind call.
The uplink and
powers are automatically
ad)usted to optimise the
connection to the phone.

XPZWIRELESS IP
The XPZ is normally controlled by a Cat 5 cable that connects the laptop to the XPZ.
We can provide you our secure wireless IP connection instead of the cable connection enabling remote
controlling of the XPZ from a safe remote location.
This is possible in different ways:
RFunits
• F o u r channels enabling four links to operate in the same area
• Secure wireless Link
• Output power of 100mW
• Simple to deploy and contain a battery (typically last for 2 hours)
• Range extensions by deploying additional units
High Powered Wi Fi units
• Longer range
• H i g h output 10-20W
• Incorporate 3G Router
COMM MESH units
• Diversity reception to greatly enhance the range and copes better with multi path conditions
• MESH Network could be linked to vvvvw by secure 36 routerNPN or satellite connection

The IV unit can be used on four channels
enabling if necessary four links to operate
in the same area.
The Cat 5 cable can be replaced by a secure
wireless link. The RF units only have an
output power of 100mW so the range is
limited but may be more than adequate in
some operational scenarios. Naturally, the
range can be extended with the use of the
appropriate aerials and choice of frequency
band. The units are very simple to deploy and
contain a battery which would typically last
for two hours.

3G-CORDM-IP MESH
The Remote Video Surveillance Vehicle System
is designed to allow covert video and audio
surveillance of a target area without detection,
allowing greater flexibility during surveillance
operations.
The system allows the operator to park the
vehicle close to the targets location, house,
office, restaurant, etc. and transmit the gathered
information back to the command location in a
surveillance van, observation point or another
support vehicle.
It allows the operational surveillance team to
monitor by video, for example, the images of the
target location from the four cameras concealed
within the vehicle.
It allows the surveillance team to monitor audio
transmissions from the target location from room
or body-worn equipment, and activate hidden
microphones linked to the Remote Case.
It also allows the operational surveillance team
to connect external video and audio equipment
to allow long range observation of a target in a
difficult environment or remote location.
Control of the system is by a digital telemetry link,
which allows full control of the camera selection,
pan, tilt, zoom functions, ias well as repeat
incoming video and audio signals from the room
or body-worn systems used by the undercover
surveillance team.
These remote systems are usually fitted into
vehicles (saloon cars, 4x4s1 that can then
be left unattended i n the surveillance area,
transmitting the intelligence information required
to the Command Surveillance Vehicle COMM/IP
MESH/3G.
Using our unique Motorbike Remote System, as
part of the total surveillance operation, allows
even greater flexibility in the covert surveillance
operation. The Motorbike Remote System allows
the surveillance team t o link several video/
audio remote systems into the total surveillance
concept.

The Model 6309 Audio scope System is a high- performance audio capturing and recording system
customized for the intelligence end-users.The unit allows an operator to zoom in on a particular object
and record required sound in much the same way as a camera zooms in a picture.This makes the unit
an ideal solution for separating out conversations in noisy environments.There is both fixed and mobile
solution.The core component of the unit is a microphone array composed of 285 individual microphones
integrated in a slim 1.5-meter dish.
The exact direction for sound pickup is steered from the video screen without any physical movement
of the dish.The advanced signal processing makes the targeted sound source clearly audible even in a
noisy environment.
ZOOM IN ON SOUND SOURCES POSTRECORDING
Any audio missed in real-time can be captured later in replay.This unique function is ideal for crowded
places where the operator does not know form whom or where he would like to separate the sound until
later.
INTUITIVE USER INTERFACE
The systems very intuitive user interface is offering fast, accurate operation of the unit.The operator
monitors the live on-screen view from the camera, and simply moves the cursor to capture selected
audio. The trackball is used to follow moving objects and the jog wheel to go back in time tor replay.
The system supports multiple output channels and the operator can select up to five listening zones
simultaneously —both in real-time and in replay.The operator can also choose to select filters to eliminate
undesirable sound and noise.

The Model 5030 is an extremely light weight and
quite flying surveillance platform. Due to the
electronic position control the AirRobot
Robot can be
flown without any pilot experience. The flying
surveillance platform can be in the air manually
controlled or is fully programmable. If receives no
commands, it remains at its height and direction,
GPS or optical position system (OPS) controlled.
This allows the pilot to concentrate fully on his
surveillance mission. Different Cameras for video
surveillance operations are available (Daylight
colour sensor, night vision, digital andThermal),
Designed specifically f o r professional
surveillance, Model 5122 uses the latest series
of ultra low light (0.00003 lux) with 'Night Mode'
cameras to produce unbeatable images in day
and night conditions,The flexible 6 to 100 x optical
zoom and pan and tilt system allows targets to
be monitored at long distances and tracked
using the proportional pan, tilt and zoom system.
Deployable in minutes and powered by battery or
mains, this rapid deployment system is a powerful
tool for any serious surveillance operation.

camera delivers images of outstanding quality,
at very low power consumption, The unit can be
used for both standalone applications and for
integrated multi-sensor systems,
The Model 5215 Infinity Lenses are the only
lenses in the world that stay in focus throughout
the entire image. Conventional lenses have a
limited depth of field, which means they can only
focus on either the foreground or the background
of an image at one time - never both.The Infinity
Lens defies this tradition. Employing ievolutionary
optics technology that can focus on objects both
in the foreground and background. the Infinity
Lens offers massive depth of field (MIN) meaning
the foreground and background of a shot are in
focus simultaneously.

forensic data recovery

Forensic data recovery is not to be confused
with standard data recovery. Data recovery is
the art of retrieving data from a source that is
not easily obtainable, (mainly hard disk drives,
memory cards, tapes. RAID systems etc), however,
Forensic data recovery is different. In standard
data recovery, the original data source, (e.g. the
dead hard drive) is rebuilt, lif required), then an
'image' is taken, at which point the data recovery
technician re-works the data so that it is useable
to the client.

Computer Forensics is the function of utilising
scientifically proven methods t o assemble
together and process data found on a digital
device, (computer, hard disk drive, mobile phone,
memory card etc), and interpret that data for
possible use in a court of law or other theatre
of investigation. The evidence may assist in the
prosecution or a criminal, help in the defense of
an accused person, or be of intelligence to an
individual who is seeking knowledge for either
personal or professional reasons.

Mobile phones are consistently used during
many forms of criminal activity, and by performing
mobile phone forensics on the cellular network
usage of a particular mobile phone it is possible to
trace where and when calls Vvere made from.This
is particularly useful in stalking type cases, where
a mobile phone has been used to harass another
individual. A mobile phone forensics firm will be
able to trace and quantify phone uses within the

security support, etc, designed for quick detection
and exact location of secretly installed indoor
micro video cameras, including cameras with
pin-hole lenses. The unit works on the optical
principal and no electromagnetic and extraneous
emissions get in its way.

GSM/UMTS DFITCTION AND
LOCATION 'The Model 7558 system uses active, patented
techniques to find any GSM and LIMTS devices
in the areas to be swept. When devices are found
the unit operator can quickly distinguish between
legitimate o r authorized mobile phones and
GSM bugging devices. Aytomated processes,
network surveying, system set up and range
selection, device detection and results analysis
make the system effective and efficient. The
system's database determines the threat level
of a suspect device and is updated on a monthly
basis to ensure the very latest threat information
is available.

pArrYFI r) 5rrA handheld fiF measurement, the 7554 unit can find
radiation sources in any surroundings from 1MHz
to 9.4GHz, including their respective frequencies
and signal strengths, directly displaying exposure
limits.The calculations are performed unnoticed
in the background by a high-pert9rmance DSP
(digital signal processor). This software offers
an incredible number of features, such as multi
device capability, high-resolution, and a display of
channel identifiers, etc.

Digital Wideband Jamming has become a n
essential part of 1ED protection, whether for
mobile applications such as motorcades but
also for all types of stationary applications in
governmental buildings. Jamming systems can
be used for jamming of RCIEDs to prevent the
activation of radio controlled roadside bombs.
With up to 2.450 Watt of output power our digital
wideband jamming system provides enough
power throughout the whole frequency spectrum
of 20 MHz up to 6.000 MHz (opt. 18.000 MHz) to
really master difficult RCIED scenarios even under
worst conditions. We are taking digital jamming
to the next level and allowing our customers to
individually program their digital jamming system.
Each system can be individually programmed and configured for optimum usage in the respective area
of usage. Based on the free-space-loss formula we can calculate and configure our systems to provide a
100 meters guaranteed protection zone around motorcades in high-threat areas.
