Case history

“Speed, totality of information and user-friendly access
are prerequisites for every online search. The immediate
comparison of results from all different kinds of online
sources is the new frontier in the creation of value.
To achieve this, sources must be uniform, aligned,
traceable... this is what Expert System's Cogito
guarantees.”

The challenge
To make ad searches simpler and
more precise

Quattroruote is the top automotive news source in Italy and
has recently invested in a semantic web application to further
boost it's level of customer service.
The company launched www.cheauto.it, an innovative search
engine which allows users to search through over 350,000
used car ads online. The ads, from numerous online sources,
are extracted and grouped into the cheAuto portal.
This gives customers the advantage of being able to consult
just one single portal to access uniform data quickly and
precisely.

The objectives

To allow the user to quickly compare
the various ads and prices with
Quattroruote's suggested retail

The results
Sales ads from various sites are now
uniform and organized into a single
database
Users can now automatically search
over 350,000 ads and receive
precise and pertinent feedback

To simplify the online search of used car ads by grouping
them into one single portal and formatting them for rapid
comparison

Semantic technology has simplified
computer-human interaction because
it allows users to make their requests
in natural languagea

To improve customers' experience by offering a quick
and easy service which allows users to search for car
models using everyday language

Suggested retail values are
immediately visible and include a
graphical assessment (red light =
high asking price, etc...)

To facilitate navigation within the portal and allow the
user to select from different search criteria: make, model,
price, mileage, etc...

Why Quattroruote chose Expert System
Quattroruote needed a system capable of automatically
gathering and organizing online sales listings to provide a
new and effective service for those in the market for a used
car.

words and phrases make it ideal for the organization of sales
ads. Expert System's solution has streamlined the search

How they work

Media

CheAuto, Quattroruote's online service helps customers find
used cars and:
quickly sorts through over 350,000 ads from the main sites
of used car listings
is different from traditional search engines because it allows
users to make their requests in everyday language; an
example search could be, “I'm looking for a 2008 Passat,
red, 6-speed in Chicago”

Benefits
Search methods are simple and fast
Results are timely and accurate

Before

automatically interprets the requests: only through semantics
is it possible to understand that “I'm looking for a 2000 Alfa
147” is different from “I'm looking for an Alfa 147 2000”
because in the first case 2000 indicates the model year and
the second case indicates engine volume

Users had to explore many different
websites in order to find the ads that
interested them and then had to
compare each of them separately

extracts the most relevant text entities from the user's
request and filters only the pertinent results; at any time,
the user can also select additional search criteria (make,
model, price, region, etc...) from simple drop-down menus

Prices were manually compared to
Quattroruote's suggested retail
values

compares the prices listed in each sales ad with
Quattroruote's suggested retail values and displays a graphical
assessment (red light for high asking prices, green light for
low asking prices and yellow light for reasonable asking
prices).

Traditional search engines function
only by keyword

After
With a single search engine, results
are obtained from multiple sources
and are more accurate
The engine allows users to make
requests using everyday language
Price comparisons are provided
automatically
