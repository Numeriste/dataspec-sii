Innova R&D Laboratories developed different kinds of
probes for data capturing, which provide accurate
capture a t different speeds. I n n o v a probes ore
designed to ovoid any type of data loss, both in
transmission and capture fases. They ore developed
with different technology, depending on their coupling
point: from 100Mb/sec copper to 10 Gb/sec optic
fiber.

Decoders For Data Decoding
Captured raw data need to be analyzed and transloted
using the appropriate decoding protocols, in order to
obtain comprehersible information. Innovo developed
a specific decoding system which i s continuously
updated in order to follow Internet protocols and
applications evolution.
