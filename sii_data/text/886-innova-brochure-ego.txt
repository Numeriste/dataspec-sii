group. Specific research tools can be used to query
stored data and identify every possible relation
between different targets or different groups of targets.
Advanced investigation tools
Ego lies a range o f efficient tools which help to
streamline investigation procedure. Localization and
positioning tools, track alarms, together with advanced
data analysis tools support LEA operators in their daily
activity.
