BlighterView HMI 2 is a complete PC-based software application for displaying and
controlling multiple Blighter radar units and associated peripherals. BlighterView HMI 2
provides users with an intuitive and simple display allowing all users to obtain the best
performance from their integrated Blighter surveillance system.

BlighterView HMI 2 provides users with a simple
interface to control and view one or more
Blighter radars. Additional controls are available
for advanced users to optimise the radar settings
and the HMI display characteristics for specific
applications.

Radar targets are clearly identified as coloured
markers overlaid onto a background map with key
target characteristics available on a mouse click;
including target location, speed and size. The colour
of each target marker can be configured to represent
target speed and direction or target size, allowing
the operator to priorotise the targets to be observed.
The user can select the duration of 'snail-trail' tracks
that are displayed, allowing the path of the target to
be plotted and predicted. BlighterView HMI 2 can
control a variety of high-performance camera and
thermal imaging systems allowing the user to
automatically cue the cameras to the target location.
To enable un-manned operation, BlighterView HMI 2
includes user-definable alert and exclusion zones.
An intruder entering an alert zone will generate a
visible and audible alarm thereby alerting the

operator to the event. Exclusion zones allow targets
to be ignored within defined areas so that they do
not distract the operator. Zones may be overlaid
and prioritised to select or ignore specific target
characteristics such as size and speed.
BlighterView HMI 2 operates on a standard PC or
laptop running Microsoft Windows. Typically, up to
six Blighter radars may be displayed simultaneously
on a single HMI. Each radar can be controlled
independently to optimise it for its environment. For
fixed installations each radar may be manually located
on the background map, however portable radars
may use their internal GPS receivers and compass to
locate themselves automatically on the map.
BlighterView HMI 2 uses an ESRl ArcGlS mapping
engine.
BlighterView HMI 2 offers the capability to display
the ground clutter map produced by the Doppler
radar. The ground clutter map shows where radar
reflections from static objects have been received
and may be overlaid onto the background map to
help easily identify radar shadow areas and predict
ground cover.
