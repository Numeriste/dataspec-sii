FSH Portable Spectrum Analyzer

MODEL 7519

Description
The FSH Series (2, 3 or 6 GHz) spectrum analyzers are compact, battery-powered
tools that provide RF measurement for TSCM based signal analysis/monitoring. In addition, the FSH3 spectrum analyzer includes a color display that reduces errors by enhancing the visibility of critical signal details. The powerful software package with signal comparison evaluation provides excellent functionality and compares previously
scanned measurement.

Applications
• TSCM Nearfield Analysis
• Cable installation and maintenance
• Verifies production line equipment
• General field use for communications installation and maintenance
• Field wireless equipment installation
and maintenance. Outdoor antenna
characteristics measurements.

Features & benefits
• Portable handheld spectrum analyzer; Small and light enough to be perfect for
handheld applications
• Superior RF Characteristics - fast, accurate, precision instrument for its price
• Color display enhances usability and visibility; 100 kHz to 3 GHz frequency range;
covers all major communication standard transmission frequencies
• RMS detector for correct digital signal analysis
• Over 4-hour battery life; extremely portable for field use
• Built-in preamplifier; improve sensitivity by 15 dB; improved instrument sensitivity
to detect more low level signals
• Selectable output power for the tracking generator; 0 dBm; test devices with higher power ratings without additional external equipment; additional narrower resolution bandwidths down to 100 Hz; improved performance measuring narrow bandwidth signals
