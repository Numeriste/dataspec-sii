PodNode - Wireless COFDM Ad-Hoc IP Mesh Technology
The PodNode technology is the latest innovation in the portfolio of Rinicom
Ltd. It allows up to 12 portable mesh nodes to be rapidly connected into a
self-forming, self-healing mesh network. It offers non-line-of-sight operation due to use of coded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
(COFDM), making the system truly dynamic and mobile, thus ensuring
secure and robust communications in the most challenging and rapidly
changing environments.
Unlike conventional legacy wireless solutions, Rinicom's PodNode COFDM
IP Ad-Hoc Mesh System constantly monitors channel state information
and reconfigures communication paths according to the predefined criteria. The system is intrinsically capable of self-healing, meaning that if one
node can no longer operate or its communication link is not suitable for the
selected sewice (for example, real-time video transmission), the other
nodes in the network can still communicate with each other - directly or
through one or more intermediate nodes, this is done with the help of
Rinicom's PodNode smart routing algorithm.
The Ad-Hoc mesh topology ensures data communications in a
point-to-point or point-to-multipoint modes, where range is no longer a
limiting factor as it can be extended by using nodes as repeaters.
With Rinicom's PodNode technology, any "shape" of wireless broadband
network can be installed rapidly:

A chain network: Ideal for perimeter and border control operations, this
type of network can be maintained whilst mobile, for example in a convoy
of vehicles where each vehicle is acting as a mobile node. Unlike some
competing solutions, Rinicom's PodNode IP mesh network doesn't require
a central bi-directional relay point, and so ensures high reliability and

robustness in hostile environments;

A random network: evolves organically to any shape, where individual
nodes select the best possible available connection ensuring pre-defined
criteria for communications performance are maintained;
A hybrid network: a network of many sub-networks, extremely useful when
large-scale installation is required or if first responders from various countries
operate on the scene with not-compatible equipment.
PodNode system comes in several variants: PodNode-l, PodNode-R, PodNode-M and PodNode-OEM.

PodNode-l is a robust aluminum enclosed PodNode module that is ideal for
integration into other systems, or standalone stationary operation.
PodNode-R is a rugged PodNode unit with an integrated battery, that can
be used for rapid deployments and mobile applications. PodNode-R comes
in three types: PodNode-R, PodNode-R-SD and PodNode-R-HD. The -R
version is the basic PodNode-R unit, -SD has got an integrated SD IP video
encoder, allowing to connect any analogue camera to the unit and stream it
via the PodNode IP network. Similarly, the -HD version has got a built-in HD
video encoder.
PodNode-M is a PodNode unit specially designed for body-worn applications. It has a built-in battery and allows any IP device to be connected to it.
PodNode-OEM is a two-board PCB solution designed for system integrators.

Iechn~calteatures
Rinicom's PodNode technology operates in a time division multiple access ('TDMA) mode, which allows all nodes in the
network operate on the same frequency.
This ensures efficient utilisation of the most valuable communications resource -frequency bandwidth, which is regulated
by Governmental bodies (OFCOM in the UK). The required bandwidth can be tuned from 5 MHz to 20 MHz in 1 MHz
steps, ensuring great flexibility and adaptation to different services (for example, low bandwidth for data and voice only
communications and high bandwidth for video surveillance). The RF output power can also be tuned by the user up to
maximum of +27dBm in 0.5dB steps. The security of the entire mesh network is guaranteed by the use of the optional
168bit 3DES encryption.
Control of the deployed network is achieved via a dedicated network management system, which also allows PTZ
controls of all installed cameras.
The PodNode-l, PodNode-R and PodNode-M are supplied in a rugged weather-proof chassis and are safe for operations
in the most challenging environments.

A PodNode MESH network can support up to 50Mbps data throughput, making it possible to transmit true realtime 1080p
HD video. PodNodes support any third party IP device, and thus may be used to expand an existing IAN or MAN. Using
Rinicom's powerful COFDM modulation, the PodNode provides robust RF communication in a variety of harsh environments.
Multiple PodNodes as part of the same network naturally expand the range of the overall network.
PodNodes operate both in mobile and fixed deployments. Typical fixed deployments include first responder, rapidly deployable wireless networks, surveillance applications and long range wireless IP networks. Mobile applications include vehicle
mounted convoy applications, body worn, mobile and advanced ground robot control.
Each PodNode may be controlled remotely through Rinicom's web interface, allowing the network operator to control each
PodNode independently, or simply to monitor network status. With or without operator control, a PodNode MESH network
'simply works'.
PodNode-l is based on Rinicom's robust PodNode COFDM IP MESH technology, and is fully compatiblewith other PodNode
MESH products in the range.

The SPTZ forms part of a line of highly integrated
surveillance products. Based around micro camera
technology, the SPTZ provides a step zoom, pan
and tilt camera in a 55mm diameter package.
The pan and tilt carries four micro cameras, each
with a different focal length lens. Issuing a zoom
command to the unit instructs it to flip the video output from camera to camera. As standard the four lens focal lengths are
4, 8, 16 and 35mm giving a very useable range of zoom angles.
Other than the obvious size advantage, using prime lenses over a varifocal or zoom lens provides a faster lens (hence better
low light performance) as well as eliminating the small low torque drives often found in zoom lenses which have a tendency
to vibrate on vehicle applications, causing picture degradation.
The unit is mounted in an environmentally sealed, CNC machined housing, with full integrated control over pan, tilt and zoom
via standard controllers.

The PodNode-M MESH video surveillance system is a powerful addition to any wireless communication surveillance system.
Each PodNode in the same network automatically connect to other PodNode based equipment to create a self-healing,
mobile and dynamic surveillance mesh network. Each PodNode-M automatically routes video, voice and data.
Th_e PodNode:M COFDM IP MESH radio is a poweml addition to any wireless communication system. PodNode-MSin the
same network automatically connect to other PodNode-MSto create a self-healing, mobile and dynamic IP mesh network.
Each PodNode-M automatically routes data around the wireless network, and may easily be configured to operate without
user intervention. This makes the system ideal for body worn and vehicle mounted scenarios.
A PodNode-M MESH network can support up to 50Mbps data throughput, making it possible to transmit true real-time
1080p HD video. The PodNode-M supports any third party IP device, and thus may be used to expand an existing LAN or
MAN. Using Rinicom's powerful COFDM modulation, PodNode-M units provide robust RF communication in a variety of
harsh environments. Multiple PodNode-MSas part of the same network naturally expand the range of the overall network.
PodNode-M operates both in mobile and fixed deployments. Typical fixed deployments include first responder rapidly
deployable wireless networks, surveillance applications and long range wireless IP networks. Mobile applications include
vehicle mounted convoy applications, body worn, mobile and advanced ground robot control. Units may be left unattended
or solar powered and enabled remotely.
Each PodNode-M may be controlled remotely through Rinicom's advanced software control, allowing the network operator
to control each PodNode-M independently, or simply to monitor network status. With or without operator control, a
PodNode-M MESH network 'simply works'.
The PodNode-M is based on Rinicom's robust PodNode COFDM IP MESH technology, and is fully compatible with other
PodNode MESH products in the range.
